  - This release notes is for the Tricircle Newton release. All features
    described here are only applicable to the Tricircle Newton release.
  - In Newton release, the Tricircle still provides OpenStack API gateway
    and networking automation functionalities to allow multiple OpenStack
    cloud, spanning in one site or multiple sites or in hybrid cloud, to
    be managed as a single OpenStack cloud.
  - After Newton release, the Tricircle will be a dedicated project for
    networking automation across Neutron in OpenStack multi-region deployment,
    and the OpenStack API gateway functionality provided by the Tricircle
    will be moved to a new project called the Trio2o.
features:
  - Admin API:
      - Pod management:
          A pod represents a region in Keystone, the pod management is to
          manage the relationship between the pod and availability zone which
          is exposed to the end user. Features including creating a pod,
          deleting a pod, retrieving pod list and retrieving a single pod are
          provided.
      - Pod binding management:
          A pod binding represents a mapping relationship between tenant and
          pod, an active pod binding for the tenant in one availability zone
          means the new resource like VM, volume will be provisioned in this
          pod if availability zone parameter specified in the request. If there
          is no any binding for the tenant in the availability zone, the
          Tricircle will automatically schedule one pod for the tenant and
          create an active tenant-pod binding. A cloud administrator is able
          to change the active pod binding manually if needed for the tenant.
          Features including creating a pod binding, deleting a pod binding,
          retrieving pod binding list and retrieving a single pod binding are
          provided.
