Description: Google Endpoints API Management
        ===============================
        
        Google Endpoints API Management manages the 'control plane' of an API by
        providing support for authentication, billing, monitoring and quota control.
        
        It achieves this by
        
        - allowing HTTP servers to control access to their APIs using the
        Google Service Management and Google Service Control APIs.
        - providing built-in, standards-compliant support for third-party authentication
        - doing this with minimal performance impact via the use of advanced
          caching and aggregation algorithms.
        - making this easy to integrate via a set of WSGI middleware
        
        
        Example:
        
           >>> application = MyWsgiApp()  # an existing WSGI application
           >>>
           >>> # the name of the controlled service
           >>> service_name = 'my-service-name'
           >>>
           >>> # The Id of a Google Cloud project with the Service Control and Service Management
           >>> # APIs enabled
           >>> project_id = 'my-project-id'
           >>>
           >>> # wrap the app for service control
           >>> from google.api.control import client, wsgi
           >>> control_client = client.Loaders.DEFAULT.load(service_name)
           >>> control_client.start()
           >>> controlled_app = wsgi.add_all(application, project_id, control_client)
           >>>
           >>> # now use the controlled in place of application
           >>> my_server.serve(controlled_app)
