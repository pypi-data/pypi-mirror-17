Don't have a django project ?
=============================

Use the quick start script ! It will create and run a django project on 0.0.0.0:8000 with just the redisboard installed.

With curl::

    curl -L https://raw.github.com/ionelmc/django-redisboard/master/run_redisboard.py | tee run_redisboard.py | sh -e

With wget::

    wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/ionelmc/django-redisboard/master/run_redisboard.py -O - | tee run_redisboard.py | sh -e

Don't want to run on 0.0.0.0:8000 ? Run::

    ./run_redisboard.py ip:port

Installation guide
==================

Install from pypi, with pip::

    pip install django-redisboard

Or with setuptools::

    easy_install django-redisboard

Add ``redisboard`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS += ("redisboard", )

After that you need to run::

    manage.py syncdb

Or if you use south you can migrate this app::

    manage.py migrate redisboard

Then you can add redis servers in the admin. You will see the stats in the changelist.

Redisboard has few css tweaks for the pages (they are optional). If you use staticfiles just run::

    manage.py collectstatic

If you do not use django.contrib.staticfiles you must manually symlink the
site-packages/redisboard/static/redisboard dir to <your media root>/redisboard.

Optional django settings
========================

To show all the details just use::

    REDISBOARD_DETAIL_FILTERS = ['.*']
