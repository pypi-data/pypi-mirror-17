            This function is used to bind a new connection to a particular controller. If the server is actually a controller itself, the controller will just ensure that its CONTROLLER REF is the same as the one passed in as an argument. If the server is an agent, it will use the CONTROLLER REF argument to determine which locally-attached controller should be used for all further interactions over the RPC connection.
