Itinerary Choice Examples

**Example Data**

This sample data file represents something like what you might use to estimate an aviation itinerary choice model.
The actual content of the file contains completely fabricated data that does not correspond to any real
itinerary choice observations, so the model results you get from this dataset will likely be poor; the
data is given only as an example for how to structure and code these models, and should not be used
to understand how to *interpret* the results.
