# Recast.AI - Python SDK

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RecastAI/SDK-python/master/misc/logo-inline.png "Recast.AI")

Recast.AI official SDK for Python.


## Synospis

This library is a pure Python interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make requests to your bots.


## Requirements

* python 2.7+


## Installation

### Via requirements.txt

From [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

```bash
recastai==1.0.0
```

From [github](https://github.com)

```bash
git+https://github.com/RecastAI/sdk-python.git#egg=recastai
```

### Via Terminal

From [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

```bash
pip install recastai
```

From [github](https://github.com)

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/RecastAI/sdk-python.git
```


## Usage

### Package

```python
import recastai

client = recastai.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)
"""response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'))"""

if response.intent().slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT:
  """Do your code..."""
```

## Specs

### Classes

This library contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* recastai.Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* recastai.Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* recastai.Intent represents an intent of the response.
* recastai.Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* recastai.RecastError is the error thrown by the library.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token (optional) and a language (optional) and provides the two following methods:

* text_request(text, \*\*options) *Performs a text request*
* file_request(file, \*\*options) *Performs a voice file request*

On each call to `text_request` or `file_request` your can override either your token or your language by passing a hash of options.

If no language is provided in the request, Recast.AI does the following:

* text_request: the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
* voice_request: your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.

*Accepted options are token, language, to override the defaults provided at initialization*

```python
import recastai

client = recastai.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)

"""Performs a text request on Recast.AI"""
response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT, token=YOUR_TOKEN, language=YOUR_LANGUAGE)

if response.intent().slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT:
  """Do your code..."""

"""Performs a voice file request on Recast.AI"""
response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'), token=YOUR_TOKEN, language=YOUR_LANGUAGE)

if response.intent().slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT:
  """Do your code..."""
```

### Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call with the two previous methods and contains the following methods:

* raw *Returns the raw unparsed response*
* source *Returns the source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents *Returns all the matched intents*
* intent(\*) *Returns the first matched intent*
* act *Returns the act of the processed sentence*
* is_assert(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is an assertion*
* is_command(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a command*
* is_wh_query(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a wh-query*
* is_yn_query(\*) *Returns whether or not the act is a yn-query*
* type *Returns the type of the processed sentence*
* is_abbreviation(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an abbreviation*
* is_entity(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for an entity*
* is_description(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for a description*
* is_human(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for a human*
* is_location(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for a location*
* is_number(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentence is asking for a number*
* sentiment *Returns the sentiment of the processed sentence*
* is_vpositive(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is very positive*
* is_positive(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is positive*
* is_neutral(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is neutral*
* is_negative(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is negative*
* is_vnegative(\*) *Returns whether or not the sentiment is very negative*
* entities *Returns all the entities*
* get(name) *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name) *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* language *Returns the language of the processed sentence*
* version *Returns the version of the API*
* timestamp *Returns the timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status *Returns the status of the response*

```python
response = client.text_request('Give me some recipes with potatoes. And cheese.')

"""Get the first sentence, aka 'Give me some recipes with potatoes'"""
first_sentence = response.sentence()

"""If the sentence if positive and the first intent matched 'recipe'..."""
if response.is_positive() and response.intent().slug == 'recipe':
  """...get all the entities matching 'ingredient'"""
  ingredients = response.all('ingredient')

  print("The request has been filled at " + response.timestamp)
```

### Intent

The Recast.AI Intent is generated by the Recast.AI Response initializer and provides the following methods:

* slug *Returns the slug of the intent*
* confidence *Returns the confidence of detection for this intent*

```ruby
response = client.text_request('Tell me a joke.')

"""If the intent is joke with a probability more than 50%"""
if response.intent().confidence > 0.5 && response.intent().slug == 'joke'
  print("A man enters a coffee, and splash")
else
  print("What do you want from me?")
end
```
### Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence initializer and provides the following methods:

* name *Returns the name of the entity*
* raw *Returns the raw text on which the entity was detected*
* confidence *Returns the confidence of detection for this entity*

In addition to this method, more attributes are generated depending of the nature of the entity, which can be one of the following:

* hex
* rgb
* agent
* tense
* chrono
* value
* deg
* formated
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number
* gender
* next
* grain
* order

```python
response = client.text_request('What can I cook with salmon ?')

if response.intent().slug == 'recipe':
  """Get the ingredient"""
  ingredient = response.get('ingredient')

  """Print the reply if the confidence is high enough"""
  if ingredient.confidence > 0.7:
    print("You asked me for a recipe with " + ingredient.value)
```

### RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from Exception, it implements the default exception methods.
