        Recast.AI official SDK for Python.
        
        
        ## Synospis
        
        This library is a pure Python interface to the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) API. It allows you to make requests to your bots.
        
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * python 2.7+
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Via requirements.txt
        
        From [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)
        
        ```bash
        recastai
        ```
        
        From [github](https://github.com)
        
        ```bash
        git+https://github.com/RecastAI/sdk-python.git#egg=recastai
        ```
        
        ### Via Terminal
        
        From [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):
        
        ```bash
        pip install recastai
        ```
        
        From [github](https://github.com)
        
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/RecastAI/sdk-python.git
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Package
        
        ```python
        import recastai
        
        client = recastai.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)
        response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)
        """response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'))"""
        
        if response.intent().slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT:
          """Do your code..."""
        ```
        
        ## Specs
        
        ### Classes
        
        This library contains 5 main classes, as follows:
        
        * recastai.Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
        * recastai.Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
        * recastai.Intent represents an intent of the response.
        * recastai.Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
        * recastai.RecastError is the error thrown by the library.
        
        Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented :)
        
        ## recastai.Client
        
        The Client can be instanciated with a token and a language (both optional)
        
        ```python
        client = recastai.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)
        ```
        
        __Your tokens__
        
        [token]: https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-Python/blob/master/misc/recast-ai-tokens.png "Tokens"
        
        ![alt text][token]
        
        *Copy paste your request access token from your bot's settings*
        
        __Your language__
        
        ```python
        client = recastai.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, 'en')
        ```
        
        *The language is a lowercase 639-1 isocode.*
        
        If you pass a token or a language in the options parameter, it will override your default client language or token
        
        ```python
        response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT)
        
        if response.intent().slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
          # Do your code...
        end
        ```
        
        ```python
        # With optional parameters
        response = client.text_request(YOUR_TEXT, token=YOUR_TOKEN, language=YOUR_LANGUAGE)
        ```
        
        __If a language is provided:__ the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used.
        
        __If no language is provided:__ the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
        
        ## File request
        
        file_request(file, options = {})
        
        If you pass a token or a language in the option parameter, it will override your default client language or token.
        
        __file format: .wav__
        ```python
        response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'))
        
        if response.intent.slug == YOUR_EXPECTED_INTENT
          # Do your code...
        end
        ```
        
        ```python
        # with optional parameters
        response = client.file_request(open(YOUR_FILE, 'rb'), token=YOUR_TOKEN, language=YOUR_LANGUAGE)
        ```
        
        __If a language is provided:__ the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used
        
        __If no language is provided:__ your bot's primary language is used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.
        
        ## recastai.Response
        
        The Response is generated after a call to either file\_request or text\_request.

        ### recastai.RecastError
        
        The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.
        
        As it inherits from Exception, it implements the default exception methods.
