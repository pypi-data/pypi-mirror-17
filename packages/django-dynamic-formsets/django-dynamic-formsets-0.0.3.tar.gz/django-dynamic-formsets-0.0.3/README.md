A jQuery plugin for managing Django formsets
============================================

This [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin helps you create more usable [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) formsets by allowing clients to add and remove forms on the client-side.

It was primarily developed by [Stanislaus Madueke](https://github.com/elo80ka), and re-packaged as a static Django app (with a couple shiny new enhancements and more docs) by [The Dallas Morning News](https://github.com/DallasMorningNews/).

Documentation will be added very soon.
