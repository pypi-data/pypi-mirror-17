PiVideo Control Software
The PiVideo software may be used to control the PiCapture processor.  Some of the functions provided by this software include:
-	Automatic or manual video source selection 
-	Optional on-screen source indication
-	Test mode control, including B&W modes, solid color, and color pattern display
-	A firmware update utility
By default, the PiVideo software communicates with the PiCapture processor using the Raspberry Pi i2c port 1.  If you are using this port for other applications,  jumpers may be used to select one of the two I2C ports as an alternative.  The default I2C address is 0x40, and the PiCapture can operate with other I2C slave devices attached to the port.  The serial port is required to perform software updates.
