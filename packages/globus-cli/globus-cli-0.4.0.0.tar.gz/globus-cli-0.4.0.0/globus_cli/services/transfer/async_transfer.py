    Single-Item Mode vs. Batch Mode
    ===

    Has two modes of operation: single-item, and batchmode.

    ---

    Single-item has behavior similar to `cp` and `cp -r`, across endpoints of
    course.

    It is the behavior you get if you use `--source-path` and `--dest-path`.

    ---

    Batchmode is the way in which `async-transfer` can be used to
    submit a Task which transfers of multiple files or directories, and it is
    used to accept paths to transfer on stdin.

    Batchmode splits each line on spaces, and treats every line as a file or
    directory item to transfer.
    Splitting is done using Python shlex in POSIX mode:
    https://docs.python.org/2/library/shlex.html

    \b
    Lines are of the form
    [--recursive] SRCPATH DSTPATH

    Skips empty lines and allows comments beginning with "#".

    \b
    Example of --batch usage:
        $ cat dat
        # file 1, simple
        ~/dir1/sourcepath1 /abspath/destpath1
        # file 2, with spaces in dest path
        # paths without explicit ~ implicitly use ~
        dir2/sourcepath2   "path with spaces/dest2"
        # dir 1, requires --recursive option
        --recursive ~/srcdir1/ /somepath/destdir1
    \b
        $ cat dat | globus transfer async-transfer \\
            --batch --sync-level checksum \\
            --source-endpoint "..." --dest-endpoint "..."

    \b
    Sync Levels
    ===

    Sync Levels are ways in which the Task determines whether or not to
    actually move a file over the network.
    Choosing a higher sync level will reduce your network traffic when files in
    your transfer already exist on the destination, but will increase local IO
    and CPU load marginally at each end of the transfer.
    We recommend using high sync levels for tasks where you know or suspect
    that a non-negligible percentage of files already exist on the destination.

    EXISTS: Determine whether or not to transfer based on file existence.
    If the destination file is absent, do the transfer.

    MTIME: Determine whether or not to transfer based on modification times.
    If source has a newer modififed time than the destination, do the transfer.

    CHECKSUM: Determine whether or not to transfer based on checksums of file
    contents.
    If source and destination contents differ, as determined by a checksum of
    their contents, do the transfer.
