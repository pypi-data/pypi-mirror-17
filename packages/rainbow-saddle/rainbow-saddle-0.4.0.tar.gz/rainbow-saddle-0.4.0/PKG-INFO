Description: Rainbow Saddle
        ==============

        rainbow-saddle is a wrapper around `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`_ to
        simplify code reloading without dropping requests.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from pypi::
        
            $ sudo pip install rainbow-saddle
        
        Or from source::
        
            $ sudo ./setup.py install
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        Sometimes doing a ``kill -HUP <gunicorn PID>`` is not sufficient to reload your
        code. For example it doesn't work well `if you host your code behind a symlink
        <https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/394>`_, or if a `.pth in your
        installation is updated to point to a different directory
        <https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/402>`_.
        
        The correct way to reload code in such situations is a bit complicated::
        
            # Reexec a new master with new workers
            /bin/kill -s USR2 `cat "$PID"`
            # Graceful stop old workers
            /bin/kill -s WINCH `cat "$PIDOLD"`
            # Graceful stop old master 
            /bin/kill -s QUIT `cat "$PIDOLD"`
        
        It also has the downside of changing the "master" process PID, which confuses
        tools such as supervisord.
        
        rainbow-saddle handles all of this for you, and never changes its PID.
        Reloading code becomes as simple as sending a ``SIGHUP`` again::
        
            $ rainbow-saddle --pid /tmp/mysite.pid gunicorn_paster development.ini --log-level debug 
            $ kill -HUP `cat /tmp/mysite.pid`
