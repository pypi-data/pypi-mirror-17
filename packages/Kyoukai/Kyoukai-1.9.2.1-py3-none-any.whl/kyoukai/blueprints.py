    A Blueprint is a container for routes.

    Blueprints have 'parent' blueprints - they inherit error handlers and hooks from them. The root blueprint has no
    parent, so it does not inherit from anything.
    Note that if a Blueprint that is not the root blueprint has a parent value of None, it is automatically set to
    inherit the root blueprint of the app.

    Blueprints allow routes like normal application objects - in fact, the application object's route function is
    implemented with an underlying root blueprint.

        bp = Blueprint("test_bp")

        @bp.route("/hello/world")
        async def hello_world(ctx: HTTPRequestContext):
            return "Hello, world"!

    Per-blueprint error handlers can also be added:

    .. code:: python

        @bp.errorhandler(500)
        async def handle_500(ctx: HTTPRequestContext, e: Exception):

    :param name: The name identifier of the blueprint.
    :param parent: The parent blueprint.
        Children blueprint inherit routes from the parent, accessible via ``Parent.routes``.
        They are also used for searching in routes when a blueprint is checked.

        If this is None, then it will be automatically set when the blueprint is added as a child to a parent
        blueprint.

        The only Blueprint that should have no parent during the run time of the app is the root blueprint.
