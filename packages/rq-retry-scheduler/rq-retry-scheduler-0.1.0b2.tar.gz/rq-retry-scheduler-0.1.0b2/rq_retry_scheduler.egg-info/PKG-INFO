        RQ Retry Scheduler
        ==================
        
        `RQ Retry Scheduler <https://github.com/mikemill/rq_retry_scheduler>`__
        extends the RQ worker class to provide functionality to enqueue jobs
        based on time.
        
        Additionally, it provides a worker that will automatically retry failed
        jobs using a backoff scheme.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Queues
        ------
        
        The ``rq_retry_scheduler.Queue`` class can be used as a drop in
        replacement for ``rq.Queue``. It provides two additional enqueuing
        methods:
        
        -  ``enqueue_at`` - Enqueue the job at the specified time. The time
           should be a ``datetime.datetime`` object with the UTC timezone.
        -  ``enqueue_in`` - Enqueue the job after the specified amount of time.
           The time should be a ``datetime.timedelta`` object.
        
        Additionally, two other methods are available ``enqueue_job_at`` and
        ``enqueue_job_in`` which work like the above methods but take a
        ``rq.Job`` object as the paramter.
        
        Scheduler
        ---------
        
        In order to move jobs from the schedule queue into the proper RQ queue a
        scheduler needs to be ran. This can be accomplished via the
        ``rqscheduler`` script. Additionally, you can extend from
        ``rq_retry_scheduler.Scheduler`` to customize the functonality.
        
        Worker
        ------
        
        A worker is provided that will requeue jobs that fail using a defiend
        backoff strategy. The worker is designed to use the functionality from
        the ``Queue`` class to control the backoff.
        
        The worker can be used by using the ``-w`` option to ``rq worker``:
        ``rq worker -w 'rq_rety_scheduler.Worker``.
        
        The backoff times and total attempts is controlled by
        ``Worker.retry_delays``.
        
        Installation
