        OMERO.gallery overview
        ======================
        
        This application is designed to support browsing of images via the hierarchy of
        Group > Project > Dataset > Image.
        
        Public access can be enabled [as described here]
        (http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/developers/Web/PublicData.html), otherwise
        users will see the standard web login screen.
        
        The home page will display all the available groups that the user can access, with a random
        thumbnail from each group. The number of Projects, Datasets and Images within each group
        will also be displayed.
        
        .. image:: http://ome.github.io/omero-gallery/images/gallery.png
        
        
        On browsing into a group, the Projects and 'orphaned' Datasets will be shown in a similar layout.
        
        .. image:: http://ome.github.io/omero-gallery/images/show_group.png
        
        Projects are shown with 5 thumbnails from each Dataset. Clicking 'All Images' will load all the remaining thumbnails
        from a chosen Dataset (or you can browse to the Dataset itself by clicking the Dataset name link).
        
        .. image:: http://ome.github.io/omero-gallery/images/show_project.png
        
        Clicking a thumbnail will take you directly to the full image viewer.
