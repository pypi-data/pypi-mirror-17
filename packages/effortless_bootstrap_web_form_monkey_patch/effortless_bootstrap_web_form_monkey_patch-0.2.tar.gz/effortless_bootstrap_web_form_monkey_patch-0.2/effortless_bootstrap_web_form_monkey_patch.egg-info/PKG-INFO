Description: # Effortless Bootstrap Web/Form Monkey Patch
        
        Bootstrap your old web/form.py forms!
        
        ## Synopsis
        
        Just because web.py hasn't been updated since 2012 doesn't mean you have to
        settle for outdated HTML layouts. Scrap that 2001-era table-based form layout,
        and use this module to create shiny, new Bootstrap 4-alpha forms!
        
        Two ways to be happy:
        
        1. Patch the old form classes.
        2. Use our backwards-compatible form classes.
        
        Either way, *you won't have to change a bit of your program logic.* It's a
        just small change at the top of the program.
        
        ## How To Patch
        
        To update your old webforms, just import and use the `patch()` function.
        
            from effortless_bootstrap_web_form_monkey_patch import patch
            patch()
        
        Now you can continue to use your old web.py forms normally.
        
        ## How to Use Backwards-Compatible Classes
        
        To use all-new but all-backwards-compatible classes, just import this package
        instead of web.form.
        
            import effortless_bootstrap_web_form_monkey_patch as form
        
        Now you can continue to use your old web.py forms normally.
        
        ## Remember to Update Your Templates
        
        Oh yeah, make sure you update the templates to use Bootstrap. The most
        important piece to remember is to wrap all Bootstrap items with a `.container`
        div.
        
            <div class="container">
              <form>
                $:form.render()
              </form>
            </div>
        
        And of course you need the CSS. If you don't want to host it locally, use their
        CDN by adding this piece to the header.
