Description: SCPLibrary for Robot Framework
        ==============================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        SCPLibrary is a `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`__ test
        library for performing Secure Copy (SCP) operations over SSH. Unlike
        the other SCPLibrary ('robotframework-scplibrary'), this one works
        hand in hand with the Robot SSHLibrary (hence
        'robotframework-scpcompat').
        
        I wrote this because I was frustrated that the non-compatible
        SCPLibrary overwrote some SSHLibrary keywords and managed connections
        itself. I did consider changing the existing library, but that would
        break it for existing users.
        
        To recap, the main differences are:
        
        - Relies on the standard SSHLibrary to manage connections
        - ``Download File`` and ``Upload File`` keywords use the currently
          active SSH connection to transfer files to the remote host
        - Does not conflict with any SSHLibrary keywords
        - Can even use an existing connection used for other SSH commands
        
        It is operating system independent, but has only been tested with
        Python. Strictly speaking, the underlying 'scp' module is also pure
        Python, so let me know if you have any luck with Jython or
        IronPython.
        
        SSHLibrary is open source software licensed under `GNU General Public
        License v3 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        When installing SCPLibrary on UNIX-like machines with Python, the
        easiest approach is using `pip <http://pip-installer.org>`__::
        
            pip install robotframework-scpcompat
        
        Note while this library supports both Python 2 and 3, SSHLibrary does
        not. So until SSHLibrary fixes `issue #144
        <https://github.com/robotframework/SSHLibrary/issues/144>`__ it
        doesn't make sense to use Python 3. Hopefully though, once it's
        resolved this library should also work with Python 3.
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The library is self-documenting via docstrings; additionally you can
        find an example robot script in this repository. You can run it
        against any host with SSH password authentication::
        
            robot -v host:xxx -v user:xxx -v pass:xxx example.robot
        
        The `scp module documentation <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scp>`__
        is also helpful, as this library is basically a wrapper around it.

        Framework, see `Robot Framework User Guide`__.
