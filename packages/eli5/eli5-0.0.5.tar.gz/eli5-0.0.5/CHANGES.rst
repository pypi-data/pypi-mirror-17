Changelog
=========

0.0.5 (2016-09-27)
------------------

* HashingVectorizer support in explain_prediction;
* add an option to pass coefficient scaling array; it is useful
  if you want to compare coefficients for features which scale or sign
  is different in the input;
* bug fix: classifier weights are no longer changed by eli5 functions.

0.0.4 (2016-09-24)
------------------

* eli5.sklearn.InvertableHashingVectorizer and
  eli5.sklearn.FeatureUnhasher allow to recover feature names for
  pipelines which use HashingVectorizer or FeatureHasher;
* added support for scikit-learn linear regression models (ElasticNet,
  Lars, Lasso, LinearRegression, LinearSVR, Ridge, SGDRegressor);
* doc and vec arguments are swapped in explain_prediction function;
  vec can now be omitted if an example is already vectorized;
* fixed issue with dense feature vectors;
* all class_names arguments are renamed to target_names;
* feature name guessing is fixed for scikit-learn ensemble estimators;
* testing improvements.

0.0.3 (2016-09-21)
------------------

* support any black-box classifier using LIME (http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938)
  algorithm; text data support is built-in;
* "vectorized" argument for sklearn.explain_prediction; it allows to pass
  example which is already vectorized;
* allow to pass feature_names explicitly;
* support classifiers without get_feature_names method using auto-generated
  feature names.

0.0.2 (2016-09-19)
------------------

* 'top' argument of ``explain_prediction``
  can be a tuple (num_positive, num_negative);
* classifier name is no longer printed by default;
* added eli5.sklearn.explain_prediction to explain individual examples;
* fixed numpy warning.

0.0.1 (2016-09-15)
------------------

Pre-release.
