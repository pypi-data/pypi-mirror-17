Description: OpenStreetMap Hall Monitor Site
        ===============================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This is a frontend for use with the [OSM Hall Monitor](https://github.com/ethan-nelson/osm_hall_monitor) monitoring package. Rather than using a command line to add things to track or to view log events, the website provides the ability to add any trackable things, review log events, and support restrictions to this data via OSM authentication. 
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Note: Python is required and virtualenv is _strongly_ recommended..
        
        - cd osmhm_site
        
        - virtualenv env
        
        - env/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - env/bin/initialize_osmhm_db development.ini
        
        - env/bin/pserve development.ini
        
        Dependencies include [OSM Diff Tool](https://github.com/ethan-nelson/osm_diff_tool) and [OSM Hall Monitor](https://github.com/ethan-nelson/osm_hall_monitor).
        
        Deploying to Cloud Services
        ---------------------------
        
        The repository contains a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) and sample scripts to run the web and process workers (including a custom SendGrid implementation). Once you deploy the repo, you will need to run the `initialize_db.py` script to prepare the database. Then, the first user to log in will be set as the server owner.
