        ==============
        
        Axessy is a simple package to read and parse messages from AXESS TMC X3 devices.
        
        ChangeLog
        -------------
        
            * 0.3: Fixed message() method
            * 0.1: First release
        
        Installation
        -------------
        
        There are two ways to install the package:
        
        1. Using pip with the following command:
            
            pip install axessy
        
        2. Start setup.py file from this repository:
            
            python setup.py install
            
        Usage
        -------------
        You can import the module in the following way:
        
            import axessy.axessy
            
        In this package there is the "AxessPackage" class defined with the following methods:
        
            * parsePacket(params): "params" includes the GET parameters sent via an "/online" or "/batch" command from the device, and stores the data inside the class variables;
            
            * message(msg, beep=100, show=2): builds a string that you can put inside an HttpResponse to send back to the device;
            
            * sendKeepAlive(url, username, password): asks the device to send a keepalive message.
            
        Also the "AxessPackage().ack" and "AxessPackage().keepalive" variables are defined for string responses to "/batch" and "/keepalive" commands.
        
        A dictionary with all possible errors saved into a transaction, "AxessPackage().error_dict", is defined and automatically used by "parsePacket" method.
        
        Finally there are two new Error classes used by the "checkPacket()" method (this method is used by "parsePacket" automatically):
        
            * MacAddressError
            
            * CardError
