Some thoughts:

Misc extras: 
    + More likely than not, all persistence remotes should also use a 
        single autoresponder, through the salmonator. Salmonator should
        then be moved into hypergolix.remotes instead of .persistence.
    + At least for now, applications must ephemerally declare themselves
        capable of supporting a given API. Note, once again, that these
        api_id registrations ONLY APPLY TO UNSOLICITED OBJECT SHARES!
    
It'd be nice to remove the msgpack dependency in utils.IPCPackerMixIn.
    + Could use very simple serialization instead.
    + Very heavyweight for such a silly thing.
    + It would take very little time to remove.
    + This should wait until we have a different serialization for all
        of the core bootstrapping _GAOs. This, in turn, should wait 
        until after SmartyParse is converted to be async.
        
IPC Apps should not have access to objects that are not _Dispatchable.
    + Yes, this introduces some overhead. Currently, it isn't the most
        efficient abstraction.
    + Non-dispatchable objects are inherently un-sharable. That's the
        most fundamental issue here.
    + Note that private objects are also un-sharable, so they should be
        able to bypass some overhead in the future (see below)
    + Future effort will focus on making the "dispatchable" wrapper as
        efficient an abstraction as possible.
    + This basically makes a judgement call that everything should be
        sharable.
