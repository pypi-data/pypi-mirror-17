class Dispatcher:
    ''' The Dispatcher decides which objects should be delivered where.
    This is decided through either:
    
    1. An API identifier (schema) dictating general compatibility as a
        dispatchable
    2. Declaring an object to be private, at which point the Dispatcher
        will internally (though distributedly) maintain that object to
        be exclusively available to an app token.
        
    Objects, once declared as non-private, cannot be retroactively 
    privatized. That cat has officially left the bag/building/rodeo.
    However, a private object can be made non-private at a later time,
    provided it has defined an API ID.
    
    Private objects do not track their owning app tokens internally.
    Instead, this is managed through a Dispatcher-internal GAO. As such,
    even a bug resulting in a leaked private object will not result in a
    leaked app token.
    
    Ideally, the dispatcher will eventually also enforce whatever user
    restrictions on sharing are desired BETWEEN INSTALLED APPLICATIONS.
    Sharing restrictions between external parties are within the purview
    of the Rolodex.
