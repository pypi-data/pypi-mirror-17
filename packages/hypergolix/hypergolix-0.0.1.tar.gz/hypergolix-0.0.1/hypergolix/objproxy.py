    [1] Proxies are hashable if their ghids are defined, but unhashable 
    otherwise. Note, however, that their hashes have nothing to do with
    their proxied objects. Also note that 
        isinstance(obj, collections.Hashable)
    will always identify ObjProxies as hashable, regardless of their 
    actual runtime behavior.
    
    [2] Equality comparisons, on the other hand, reference the proxy's 
    state directly. So if the states compare equally, the two ObjProxies 
    will compare equally, regardless of the proxy state (ghid, api_id, 
    etc).
    
    [3] The primary concern here is NOT enforcing access restrictions,
    which you cannot do in python anyways (we're all consenting adults!)
    but rather to prevent name conflicts, particularly since we're 
    passing through attribute access to arbitrary proxy objets. As such,
    instead of manually enumerating all of the possible implementation
    detail methods, we're name mangling them by postpending '_3141592' 
    to the method name. We're doing this instead of the default python
    name mangling, because we'd like them to be trivially available to
    subclasses (if necessary).
    
    Side note: as per python docs, support for magic methods ("dunder",
    or "double underscore" methods) is only reliable if declared 
    directly and explicitly within the class.
