           from pykeepass import PyKeePass
        
           # load database
           kp = PyKeePass(
              'db.kdbx',
              password='somePassw0rd'
           )
        
           # find any group by its name
           group = pk.find_group_by_name('folder1')
        
           # find any entry by its title
           entry = pk.find_entry('test')
        
           # retrieve the associated password
