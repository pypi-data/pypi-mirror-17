        ============
        
        This library allows you to write entries to a KeePass database
        
        .. code-block::
        
           import pykeepass
           # load database
           kdb = pykeepass.open(
              'db.kdbx',
              password='somePassw0rd'
           ).__enter__()
           # find any group by its name
           group = pykeepass.find_group_by_name(kdb.tree, 'folder1')
           # find any entry by its title
           entry = pykeepass.find_entry(kdb.tree, 'test')
           # retrieve the associated password
           pykeepass.get_entry_password_field(entry).Value
           # write a new entry
           pykeepass.create_entry(
              kdb.tree,
              group,
              'new_entry',
              'myusername',
              'myPassw0rdXX'
           )
           # save database
           with open('/tmp/pykeepass.kdbx', 'w+') as f:
