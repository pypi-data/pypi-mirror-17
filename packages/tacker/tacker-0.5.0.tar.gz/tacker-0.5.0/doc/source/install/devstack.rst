Multi Node Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a multi-node devstack environment where controller, network and compute
nodes are separate, some neutron agents should not be installed in the
controller node. In such cases, use the following local.conf setting to disable
neutron agents in the controller node::

    [[local|localrc]]
    TACKER_NEUTRON_AGENTS=''
