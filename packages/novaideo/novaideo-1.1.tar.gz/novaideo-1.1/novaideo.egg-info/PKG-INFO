        Getting Started for development
        -------------------------------
        
        To run in development mode without docker::
        
            python3.4 bootstrap.py
            bin/buildout
            bin/runzeo -C etc/zeo.conf
            bin/pserve development.ini
        
        The application is on http://localhost:6543
        
        
        To run in development mode with docker::
        
            ./run.sh rebuild
            ./run.sh
        
        The app is deployed on https://local.ecreall.com:8443
        (local.ecreall.com resolves to 127.0.0.1 and is necessary for nginx)
        
        To send emails, you need to configure the MAILER variables in
        **docker-compose-dev.yml**
        The default configuration is used to connect with a postfix via a ssh tunnel
        like this::
        
            ssh -L 172.17.0.1:9025:localhost:25 myserver.example.com
        
        
        Deployment with docker
        ----------------------
        
        Clone a specific version::
        
            git clone -b VERSION git@github.com:ecreall/nova-ideo.git
            cd nova-ideo
        
        (replace VERSION with the latest release, 1.1 for example)
        
        docker-compose runs a nginx container on port 80 and 443.
        You need to edit the **nginx-app-prod.conf** file to replace mynovaideo.example.com
        by your domain and add certificates (**server.key** and **server.crt**) to the
        **tls** directory.
        
        You need to configure some environment variables, copy the file
        **docker-compose.override.yml.templ** to **docker-compose.override.yml** and edit it.
        
        - SECRET: the initial admin password
        - APPLICATION_URL: your domain, same as you put in nginx-app-prod.conf
        - MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER: the sender of the mails that the application use
        - MAILER_HOST: SMTP host
        - MAILER_PORT: SMTP port
        - MAILER_USERNAME: SMTP username
        - MAILER_PASSWORD: SMTP password
        - MAILER_TLS: Use TLS
        - MAILER_SSL: Use SSL
        
        If you want to connect to a postfix container, there is a commented example
        in **docker-compose.override.yml.templ** that use an external postfix container
        connected on a mybridge bridge network. You need to create a mybridge bridge
        network and start a postfix container yourself. (not documented here)
        
        To deploy::
        
            sudo docker-compose up -d
        
        To connect with the super administrator (for the evolve steps and to create
        an other admin account only), go to
        https://mynovaideo.example.com/manage
        and log in with "admin" and the password is the one you gave in the SECRET
        environment variable.
        
        After the initial connection, you can increase the number of workers that are
        used to handle the requests in **docker-compose.override.yml** and run again
        **sudo docker-compose up -d** (WORKERS=3 is a good default).
        
        
        How to upgrade your install
        ---------------------------
        
        For each release, a docker image is built and the **docker-compose.yml** is
        modified accordingly.
        
        If you previously cloned the repository with version 1.0, to upgrade to 1.1 for
        example, do::
        
            git checkout 1.1
            sudo docker-compose up -d
        
        After that, be sure to execute the evolve steps by connecting with the super
        administrator at https://mynovaideo.example.com/manage
        and going to *Database* tab, and click on *Evolve* red button. You can see
        the evolve steps with the *Summarize* button.
        
        
        Backup and maintainance of your database
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Your data is in the var folder, be sure to backup it.
        
        The database is a ZODB filestorage, you should pack it regularly (every week)
        to reduce its size. Example of cron for user root run at 1am sunday:
        
            0 1 * * 0 docker exec novaideo_novaideo_1 /app/bin/zeopack -d 1 -u /app/var/zeo.sock
        
        Be sure that the container name is novaideo_novaideo_1 in your case. You can
        verify it with **docker ps**.
