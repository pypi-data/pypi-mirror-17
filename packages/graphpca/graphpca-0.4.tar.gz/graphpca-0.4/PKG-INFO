Description: graphpca
        ===========
        
        Produces a low-dimensional representation of the input graph.
        
        Calculates the ECTD [1]_ of the graph and reduces its dimension using PCA. The
        result is an embedding of the graph nodes as vectors in a low-dimensional
        space.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Get a 2D PCA of a high-dimensional graph and plot it.
        ::
        
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> import graphpca
            >>> g = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(1000, 0.2)
            >>> g_2 = graphpca.reduce_graph(g, 2)
            >>> graphca.plot_2d(g_2)
        
        .. image:: output/erg-1000.png
        
        Draw a graph, including edges, from a mat file
        ::
        
            >>> import scipy.io
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> import graphpca
            >>> mat = scipy.io.loadmat('test/bcspwr01.mat')
            >>> A = mat['Problem'][0][0][1].todense()  # that's just how it came
            >>> G = nx.from_numpy_matrix(A)
            >>> graphpca.draw_graph(G)
