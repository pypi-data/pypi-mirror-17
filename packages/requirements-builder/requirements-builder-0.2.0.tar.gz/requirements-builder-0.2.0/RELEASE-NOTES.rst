Build requirements files from setup.py requirements.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  cannot redirect the output to a file. See more at
  https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/tox/issues/73/pipe-output-of-command-into-file

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixes problem when the setup.py command try to import the package
  its about to install in order to get the information like the

  read, exec, or whatever.
