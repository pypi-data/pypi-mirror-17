.. code:: python
    
    #coding=utf8
    import itchat, time

    @itchat.msg_register(['Text', 'Map', 'Card', 'Note', 'Sharing'])
    def text_reply(msg):

    itchat.run()

**Advanced uses**

*Command line QR Code*

You can access the QR Code in command line through using this command:

.. code:: python

    itchat.auto_login(enableCmdQR=True)

Because of width of some character differs from systems, you may adjust the enableCmdQR to fix the problem.

.. code:: python

    # for some linux system, width of block character is one instead of two, so enableCmdQR should be 2
    itchat.auto_login(enableCmdQR=2)

Default background color of command line is dark (black), if it's not, you may set enableCmdQR to be negative:

.. code:: python

    itchat.auto_login(enableCmdQR=-1)

*Hot reload*

By using the following command, you may reload the program without re-scan QRCode in some time.

.. code:: python

    itchat.auto_login(hotReload=True)

*User search*

By using `get_friends`, you have four ways to search a user:

1. Get your own user information
2. Get user information through `UserName`
3. Get user information whose remark name or wechat account or nickname matches name key of the function
4. Get user information whose remark name, wechat account and nickname match what are given to the function

Way 3, 4 can be used together, the following is the demo program:

.. code:: python

    # get your own user information
    itchat.get_friends()
    # get user information of specific username
    itchat.get_friends(userName='@abcdefg1234567')
    # get user information of function 3
    itchat.get_friends(name='littlecodersh')
    # get user information of function 4
    itchat.get_friends(wechatAccount='littlecodersh')
    # combination of way 3, 4
    itchat.get_friends(name='LittleCoder机器人', wechatAccount='littlecodersh')

*Download and send attachments*

The attachment download function of itchat is in Text key of msg

Name of the file (default name of picture) is in FileName key of msg

Download function accept one location value (include the file name) and store attachment accordingly.

.. code:: python

    @itchat.msg_register(['Picture', 'Recording', 'Attachment', 'Video'])
    def download_files(msg):
        msg['Text'](msg['FileName'])
        itchat.send('@%s@%s'%('img' if msg['Type'] == 'Picture' else 'fil', msg['FileName']), msg['FromUserName'])
        return '%s received'%msg['Type']

If you don't want a local copy of the picture, you may pass nothing to the function to get a binary string.

.. code:: python

    @itchat.msg_register(['Picture', 'Recording', 'Attachment', 'Video'])
    def download_files(msg):
        with open(msg['FileName'], 'wb') as f:
            f.write(msg['Text']())

**FAQ**

Q: Why I can't send files whose name is encoded in utf8?

A: That's because of the upload setting of requests, you can put `this file <https://gist.github.com/littlecodersh/9a0c5466f442d67d910f877744011705>`__ (for py3 you need `this <https://gist.github.com/littlecodersh/e93532d5e7ddf0ec56c336499165c4dc>`__) into packages/urllib3 of requests package.

Q: Why I still can't show QRCode with command line after I set enableCmdQr key to True in itchat.auto_login()?

A: That's because you need to install optional site-package pillow, try this script: pip install pillow
