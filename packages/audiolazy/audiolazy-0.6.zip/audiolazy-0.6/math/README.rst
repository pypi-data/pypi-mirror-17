AudioLazy Math
==============

This directory have scripts with some symbolic math calculations that should
be seen as a proof, or perhaps as a helper on understanding, for some
equations written as part of the AudioLazy code. For such a symbolic
processing, the `Sympy <http://sympy.org/>`__ CAS (Computer Algebra System)
Python package was used.

Originally, some of these results were done manually, but all were needed
for designing some part of AudioLazy. Regardless of their difficulty,
the blocks implemented in AudioLazy just use the results from here, and
doesn't require Sympy to work.


Running
-------

They're all scripts, you should just run them or call Python. Works on both
Python 2 and 3, but be sure to have Sympy installed before that::

  pip install sympy

So you can run them directly like you would with an AudioLazy example, with
one of the following lines::

  ./script_name.py
  python script_name.py
  python3 script_name.py

(where obviously you should replace ``script_name`` with the script file
name).


Proofs
------

* `lowpass_highpass_bilinear.py <lowpass_highpass_bilinear.py>`__

  An extra proof using the bilinear transformation method for designing the
  single pole and single zero IIR lowpass and highpass filters from their
  respective Laplace filters prewarped at the desired cut-off frequencies.
  The result matches the ``highpass.z`` and ``lowpass.z`` strategies.

* `lowpass_highpass_digital.py <lowpass_highpass_digital.py>`__

  Includes the digital filter design of the ``lowpass.pole``, ``highpass.z``,
  ``highpass.pole`` and ``lowpass.z`` strategies.

* `lowpass_highpass_matched_z.py <lowpass_highpass_matched_z.py>`__

  Includes the analog filter design (Laplace) for a single pole lowpass IIR
  filter, and for a single zero and single pole highpass IIR filter. These
  are then converted to digital filters as a matched Z-Transform filter
  (pole-zero mapping/matching), which yields the equations used by the
  ``lowpass.pole_exp`` and ``highpass.z_exp`` filter strategies. These are
  then mirrored to get the ``lowpass.z_exp`` and ``highpass.pole_exp`` filter
  strategies.
