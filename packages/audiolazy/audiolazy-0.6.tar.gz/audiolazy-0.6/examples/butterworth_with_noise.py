Two butterworth filters with Scipy applied to white noise

This example is based on the experiment number 34 from

  Demonstrations to accompany Bregmanâ€™s Auditory Scene Analysis

by Albert S. Bregman and Pierre A. Ahad.

This experiment shows the audio is perceived as pitched differently on the
100ms glimpses when the context changes, although they are physically
identical, i.e., the glimpses are indeed perceptually segregated from the
background noise.

Noise ranges are from [0; 2kHz] and [2kHz; 4kHz] and durations are 100ms and
400ms instead of the values declared in the original text. IIR filters are
being used instead of FIR ones to get the noise, and the fact that originally
there's no silence between the higher and lower pitch contexts, but the core
idea of the experiment remains the same.

## That can be done without scipy using the equation directly:
#filt_low = ((2.90e-4 + 1.16e-3 * z ** -1 + 1.74e-3 * z ** -2
#                     + 1.16e-3 * z ** -3 + 2.90e-4 * z ** -4) /

#                     - 2.25    * z ** -3 +  .474   * z ** -4))

## Likewise, using the equation directly this one would be:
