    Retrieves one or more messages, with a maximum limit of 10 messages, from the specified queue. Long poll support is enabled by using the WaitTimeSeconds parameter. For more information, see Amazon SQS Long Poll in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .
    Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set of machines is sampled on a ReceiveMessage call. This means only the messages on the sampled machines are returned. If the number of messages in the queue is small (less than 1000), it is likely you will get fewer messages than you requested per ReceiveMessage call. If the number of messages in the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in a particular ReceiveMessage response; in which case you should repeat the request.
    For each message returned, the response includes the following:
    The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the message. For more information, see Queue and Message Identifiers in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .
    You can provide the VisibilityTimeout parameter in your request, which will be applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the response. If you do not include the parameter, the overall visibility timeout for the queue is used for the returned messages. For more information, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .
