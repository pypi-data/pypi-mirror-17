:type deploymentConfigName: string
:param minimumHealthyHosts: The minimum number of healthy instances that should be available at any time during the deployment. There are two parameters expected in the input: type and value.
            The type parameter takes either of the following values:
            HOST_COUNT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of healthy instances as an absolute value.
            FLEET_PERCENT: The value parameter represents the minimum number of healthy instances as a percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment. If you specify FLEET_PERCENT, at the start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to the equivalent number of instance and rounds up fractional instances.
            The value parameter takes an integer.
            For example, to set a minimum of 95% healthy instance, specify a type of FLEET_PERCENT and a value of 95.
            value (integer) --The minimum healthy instance value.
            type (string) --The minimum healthy instance type:
            HOST_COUNT: The minimum number of healthy instance as an absolute value.
            FLEET_PERCENT: The minimum number of healthy instance as a percentage of the total number of instance in the deployment.
            In an example of nine instance, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment will be successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instance at a time. The deployment will be successful if four or more instance are deployed to successfully; otherwise, the deployment fails.
            Note
            In a call to the get deployment configuration operation, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime will return a minimum healthy instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition, with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy will try to ensure that all instances but one are kept in a healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one instance at a time to be taken offline for a new deployment, it also means that if the deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment still succeeds.

            Note
            CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime is the default deployment configuration. It is used if a configuration isn't specified for the deployment or the deployment group.
            The predefined deployment configurations include the following:
            CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce attempts to deploy an application revision to as many instances as possible at once. The status of the overall deployment will be displayed as Succeeded if the application revision is deployed to one or more of the instances. The status of the overall deployment will be displayed as Failed if the application revision is not deployed to any of the instances. Using an example of nine instances, CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce will attempt to deploy to all nine instances at once. The overall deployment will succeed if deployment to even a single instance is successful; it will fail only if deployments to all nine instances fail.
            CodeDeployDefault.HalfAtATime deploys to up to half of the instances at a time (with fractions rounded down). The overall deployment succeeds if the application revision is deployed to at least half of the instances (with fractions rounded up); otherwise, the deployment fails. In the example of nine instances, it will deploy to up to four instances at a time. The overall deployment succeeds if deployment to five or more instances succeed; otherwise, the deployment fails. The deployment may be successfully deployed to some instances even if the overall deployment fails.
            CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime deploys the application revision to only one instance at a time. For deployment groups that contain more than one instance:
            The overall deployment succeeds if the application revision is deployed to all of the instances. The exception to this rule is if deployment to the last instance fails, the overall deployment still succeeds. This is because AWS CodeDeploy allows only one instance at a time to be taken offline with the CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime configuration.
            The overall deployment fails as soon as the application revision fails to be deployed to any but the last instance. The deployment may be successfully deployed to some instances even if the overall deployment fails.
            In an example using nine instances, it will deploy to one instance at a time. The overall deployment succeeds if deployment to the first eight instances is successful; the overall deployment fails if deployment to any of the first eight instances fails.
            For deployment groups that contain only one instance, the overall deployment is successful only if deployment to the single instance is successful
