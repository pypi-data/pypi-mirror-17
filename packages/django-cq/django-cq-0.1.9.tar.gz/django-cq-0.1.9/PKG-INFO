Description: # django-cq
        
        
        ## Description
        
        An attempt to implement a distributed task queue for use with Django channels.
        Modelled after RQ and Celery, complex task workflows are possible, all leveraging
        the Channels machinery.
        
        
        ## Why
        
        There are two reasons:
        
         1. Aiming for more fault tolerant tasks. There are many occasions where information
            regarding how tests are progressing is needed to be stored persistently. For
            important tasks, this should be stored even in the case of a Redis fault, or if
            the worker goes down.
        
         2. Prefer to leverage the same machinery as channels.
        
         3. Would like to have a little extra functionality surrounding subtasks that didn't
            seem to be available via Celery or RQ.
        
        
        ## Limitations
        
        There are two limitations involved:
        
          * REDIS must be used as the Django cache.
        
          * `asgi_redis` must be used as the channel backend.
        
        There is work being done to remove these restrictions.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use pip if you can:
        
        ```bash
        pip install cq
        ```
        
        or live on the edge:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e https://github.com/furious-luke/django-cq.git#egg=django-cq
        ```
        
        Add the package to your settings file:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
           'cq',
           ...
        ]
        ```
        
        And include the routing information in your channel routing list:
        
        ```python
        channel_routing = [
            include('cq.routing.channel_routing'),
            ...
        ]
        ```
        
        You'll need to migrate to include the models:
        
        ```bash
        ./manage.py migrate
        ```
        
        You'll most likely want to create a new channel layer for your CQ
        tasks. The default layer has a short time-to-live on the channel messages,
        which causes slightly long running tasks to kill off any queued messages.
        Update your settings file to include the following:
        
        ```python
        CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
            'default': {
                ...
            },
            'long': {
                'BACKEND': 'asgi_redis.RedisChannelLayer',
                'CONFIG': {
                    'hosts': [REDIS_URL],
                    'expiry': 1800,
                    'channel_capacity': {
                        'cq-tasks': 1000
                    }
                },
                'ROUTING': 'path.to.your.channels.channel_routing',
            },
        }
        
        CQ_CHANNEL_LAYER = 'long'
        ```
        
        
        ## Tasks
        
        Basic task usage is straight forward:
        
        ```python
        @task
        def send_email(task, addr):
            ...
            return 'OK'
        
        task = send_emails.delay('dummy@dummy.org')
        task.wait()
        print(task.result)  # "OK"
        ```
        
        Tasks may also be run in serial by just calling them:
        
        ```python
        result = send_email('dummy@dummy.org')
        print(result)  # "OK"
        ```
        
        
        ## Subtasks
        
        For more complex workflows, subtasks may be launched from within
        parent tasks:
        
        ```python
        @task
        def send_emails(task):
            ...
            for addr in email_addresses:
                task.subtask(send_email, addr)
            ...
            return 'OK'
        
        task = send_emails.delay()
        task.wait()
        print(task.result)  # "OK"
        ```
        
        The difference between a subtask and another task launched using `delay` from
        within a task is that the parent task of a subtask will not be marked as complete
        until all subtasks are also complete.
        
        ```python
        from cq.models import Task
        
        @task
        def parent(task):
            task_a.delay()  # not a subtask
            task.subtask(task_b)  # subtask
        
        parent.delay()
        parent.status == Task.STATUS_WAITING  # True
        # once task_b completes
        parent.wait()
        parent.status == Task.STATUS_COMPLETE  # True
        ```
        
        
        ## Chained Tasks
        
        ```python
        @task
        def calculate_something(task):
            return calc_a.delay(3).chain(add_a_to_4, (4,))
        ```
        
        
        ## Repeating Tasks
        
        CQ comes with basic repeating tasks. There are two ways to create
        repeating tasks:
        
         1. From the Django admin.
        
         2. Using a data migration.
