About ANNOgesic
---------------
ANNOgesic is a modular, command-line tool that can
integrated different types of RNA-Seq data like dRNA-Seq or RNA-Seq
generated after transcript fragmentation and generates high quality
genome annotations. It can detect gene, CDS/tRNA/rRNA, TSS and
processing sites, transcripts, terminator, Untranslated region (UTR)
as well as small RNA (sRNA), small open reading frame (sORF), circular
RNA, CRISPR related RNAs, riboswitch and RNA-thermometer.
It can also perform RNA-RNA
and protein-protein interaction predictions. Furthermore, it groups
genes into operon and sub-operons and reveal promotor motifs. It can
also allocate GO term and subcellular localization to genes. Several
of ANNOgesic features are new implementation while others are
performed and improved by third-party tools and for some of them
adaptive parameter-optimizations were included. Additionally, numerous
visualization and statistitcs help the user quickly evaluated feature
predictions resulting from an ANNOgesic analysis. The pipeline is
modular and was heavily tested with several RNA-Seq data set from
bacterial as well as archaeal samples.
