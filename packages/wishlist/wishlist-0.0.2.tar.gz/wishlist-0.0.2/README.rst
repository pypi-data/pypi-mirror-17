Wishlist
========

Python library to grab your Amazon wishlist so you can mess with it
programmatically.

Dependencies
------------

Before you can use this you have to have a few things installed, on
Ubuntu, you can run these commands:

::

    $ sudo su
    $ apt-get install --no-install-recommends firefox
    $ apt-get install --no-install-recommends xvfb

To install the Firefox web browser and the X11 virtual file buffer.

1 minute gettings started
-------------------------

Is your wishlist private? Then you will need to authenticate on the
command line:

::

    $ wishlist auth

This will prompt you to signin and will even handle 2-factor
authentication, after you signin your cookies will be saved so you can
run now access your Amazon wishlist.

You can check access to your wishlist on the command line by running:

::

    $ wishlist dump NAME

where ``NAME`` is the part of a url like
``https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/NAME``, so, if your
wishlist was found at:
``https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/9YDNFG31NSSRL`` then you
would run:

::

    $ wishlist dump 9YDNFG31NSSRL

If you wanted to do something in another python script, you can do:

.. code:: python

    from wishlist.core import Wishlist, ParseError

    name = "9YDNFG31NSSRL"
    with Wishlist.lifecycle() as w:
        for item in w.get(name):
            # do something with the item
            pass

You can check the ``wishlist.core.WishlistElement`` code to understand
the structure of each wishlist item.
