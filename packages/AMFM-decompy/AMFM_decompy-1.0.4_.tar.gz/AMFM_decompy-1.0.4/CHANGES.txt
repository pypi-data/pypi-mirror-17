v1.0.4, 13/Jan/2015

- segmentation fault issue in pYAAPT.py fixed.
- online documentation added.

v1.0.3, 23/Dec/2014 

- several bugs related to the analysis of 44,1 kHz files fixed. Thanks to 
  Tomasz Toczyski for reporting them.
- "growing pitch and merit vectors" bug in the peaks function from pYAAPT.py 
  fixed.
- "Stop in Dynamic" exceptions in path1 function from pYAAPT.py removed. They 
  were inherited from the original MATLAB code, but apperently don't have a
  real use or meaning.
-  internal interpolation functions changed from spline to pchip in order to 
  keep the fidelity to the original MATLAB code and also to produce better
  results.
- "pchip" option added and set as default to the PitchObj method "upsample" in
  pYAAPT.py. This interpolation method is favored over "spline" because 
  produces less horrible pitch spikes.
- "single sample upsample" bug in PitchObj method "upsample" from
  pYAAPT.py fixed.
- support for stereo files added.
- documentation updated.

v1.0.2, 27/Nov/2014 

- "missing thread package" bug in basic_tools.py fixed.

v1.0.1, 20/Sep/2014 

- 'f0_min' bug in pYAAPT fixed.
- PitchObj.mean_energy attribute added.
- two SignalObj classes merged into only one.
- minor PEP8, functions and commentaries changes.
- documentation added.

- Initial release.
