S3tail is a simple tool to help access log files stored in an S3 bucket in the same way one might
use the \*nix ``tail`` command (with far fewer options, notably the lack of a ``follow`` option).

* Free software: MIT license
* Documentation: https://s3tail.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

S3tail downloads and displays the content of files stored in S3, optionally starting at a specific
prefix. For example, the following will start dumping all the log file contents found for August the
fourth in the order S3 provides from that prefix onward::

   $ s3tail s3://my-logs/production/s3/production-s3-access-2016-08-04

When s3tail is stopped or interrupted, it'll print a bookmark to be used to pick up at the exact
spot following the last log printed in a previous run. Something like the following might be used to
leverage this ability to continue tailing from a previous stopping point::

   $ s3tail s3://my-logs/production/s3/production-s3-access-2016-08-04
   ...
   ...a-bunch-of-file-output...
   ...
   INFO:s3tail:Bookmark: production/s3/production-s3-access-2016-08-04-00-20-31-61059F36E0DBF36E:706

This can then be used to pick up at line ``707`` later on, like this::

   $ s3tail s3://my-logs/production/s3/production-s3-access-2016-08-04 \
     -b production/s3/production-s3-access-2016-08-04-00-20-31-61059F36E0DBF36E:706

It's safe to re-run the s3tail sessions when working with piped commands searching for data in the
stream (e.g. ``grep``). S3tail keeps files in a local file system cache for 24 hours by default, and
will always read and display from the cache if found before trying to download the content from
S3. This is all done in a best-effort background thread to avoid impacting performance.

The file cache is stored in the user's ``HOME`` directory, in an ``.s3tailcache`` subdirectory,
hashed by the S3 keynames using SHA-256 to avoid collisions.

Check out ``s3tail --help`` for full usage information.

* TODO

  * allow for digit ranges to be looked up

  * add ability to expresss bookmark "manually" by setting the actual key of the *CURRENT* file and
    do search looking for one previous? consider having all bookmarks like this! way better
    usability
