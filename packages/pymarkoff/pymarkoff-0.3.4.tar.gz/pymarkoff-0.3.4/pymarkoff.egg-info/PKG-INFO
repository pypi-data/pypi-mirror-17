Description: Originally a proof of concept, I've used this in enough projects that
        I've decided to publish it tomake it easier to import. The name is a
        play on words similar to Markup/Markdown.
        
        Basic Use
        =========
        
        Instantiate with ``m = markoff.Markov(seeds)`` where ``seeds`` is an
        iterable of sub-iterables. Each sub-iterable being a chain in the set of
        chains you want to model.
        
        You can supply it with just one chain or many.
        
        Then use ``m.generate(max_length=100)`` to produce a single chain
        limited to ``max_length`` automatically terminating at any character of
        ``.!?``. You can also supply a ``terminators`` argument to make the
        chain
        
        Example
        =======
        
        Code
        ----
        
        ::
        
            m = markoff.Markov(
                [
                    ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumped', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog.'],
                    ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill', 'ran', 'up', 'the', 'hill', 'to', 'fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of', 'water.'],
                    ['Whenever', 'the', 'black', 'fox', 'jumped', 'the', 'squirrel', 'gazed', 'suspiciously.']
                ]
            )
            [m.generate() i for i in range(10)]
        
        Output
        ------
        
        ::
        
            [
                'The quick brown fox jumped over the black fox jumped the lazy dog.',
                'The quick brown fox jumped the squirrel gazed suspiciously.',
                'Whenever the squirrel gazed suspiciously.',
                'Jack and Jill ran up the lazy dog.',
                'Jack and Jill ran up the hill to fetch a pail of water.',
                'Jack and Jill ran up the black fox jumped the hill to fetch a pail of water.',
                'Whenever the lazy dog.',
                'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.',
                'Jack and Jill ran up the hill to fetch a pail of water.',
                'Jack and Jill ran up the squirrel gazed suspiciously.'
             ]
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This module is still under development and is mostly for me to play
        around with and learn Markov Chains. Cheers.
