Description: SciExp² (aka *SciExp square* or simply *SciExp2*) stands for *Scientific
        Experiment Exploration*, which contains a comprehensive framework for easing
        the workflow of creating, executing and evaluating experiments.
        
        The driving idea behind the provided abstractions is that of the need for quick
        and effortless *design-space exploration*. That is, the definition and
        evaluation of experiments that are based on the permutation of different
        parameters in the design space.
        
        The framework is available in the form of Python modules which can be
        integrated into your own applications, but also comes with some interfaces to
        allow for quick writing without having to import a whole set of modules and
        instantiate objects of their corresponding classes.
