        The add on ``collective.easyform`` adds Plone content types for form creation.
        
        EasyForm provides a Plone form builder through-the-web using fields, widgets, actions and validators (based on Dexterity).
        Form input can be saved or emailed.
        A simple and user-friendly interface allows non-programmers to create custom forms.
        
        Note: This Plone package is similar to Archetypes based ``Products.PloneFormGen`` for Plone versions 1 to 4.
        Dexterity is a new platform for content types in Plone and will be used instead of Archetypes in Plone 5.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - Install product (in your buildout.cfg add ‘collective.easyform’ to the eggs section),
          rerun your Plone instance and activate ``EasyForm``.
        - Choose EasyForm from the toolbars 'Add new' menu.
          Insert form title, description and other settings.
        - Add fields or fieldsets to create a unique form that will meet your particular requirements.
          There are enough basic field types to satisfy any demands:
        
          - File Upload,
          - Text line (String),
          - Integer,
          - Yes/No,
          - Date, Date/Time,
          - Floating-point number,
          - Choice,
          - Rich Text,
          - Image,
          - Multiple Choice,
          - Text,
          - Password,
          - ReСaptcha.
        - Continue to customize form by setting the order of fields,
          defining required and hidden ones,
          choosing validator, if necessary,
          and other field type specific settings.

        - look up email_from_address in registry
          [kcleong]
        
        - Move the default xml configuration out into xml files. These can be picked up
          by ``i18ndude`` or other po file generators for translations strings. Also
          translate the ``FIELDS_DEFAULT`` fields.
          [thet]
        
        - Add German translations.
          [thet]

          mechanism.
          [thet]
        
        - Reworked mail address formating, avoiding recipient address in the form of
          ``name <<account@domain.com>>`` and having instead
          ``name <account@domain.com>``.
          [thet]
        
        - Depend on plone.schemaeditor > 2.0 for JS compatibility.
