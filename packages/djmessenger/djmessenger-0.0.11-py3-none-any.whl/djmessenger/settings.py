## DJM_ROUTING_POLICY

DJM_ROUTING_POLICY defines the lifecycle of a message being received, handling
it and lastly send some response back. In the following format, each router
represents a type of message received, handlers represent which handlers should
be used to handle this type of message and lastly which senders should be used
to send the response back.

DEFAULT is a special type, it is not a type that Facebok would send over but it
is merely for DJM to know that the handlers listed in DEFAULT should apply to
all other types as well.

For example, in the following default policy, router[1], it basically means

1. If we got a message type is sticker
2. send the message to ThumbUpHandler
3. ThumbUpHandler.should_handle() will check whether it is valid to handle this
   message, if yes, handle it
4. Then senders defines which Sender class should be used to send something back
