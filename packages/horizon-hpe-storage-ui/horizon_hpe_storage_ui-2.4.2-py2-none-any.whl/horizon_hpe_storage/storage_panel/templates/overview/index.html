  <h4>This HPE Horizon plug-in is provided to help administrators better manage their OpenStack
  Cinder environment and HPE 3PAR StoreServ backend storage arrays.</h4>
  The main functions of this plug-in are:
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Validate OpenStack Cinder configuration files to ensure they are properly specified.</li>
    <li>Provide detailed views of all HPE Storage Arrays configured for Cinder backend
      storage.</li>
    <li>Provide a direct link between OpenStack volumes and their associated detail views
    in the HPE storage management console.</li>
    <li>Query Nova nodes for active Volume Paths. This information can be used to validate storage
      volume attachments to instance nodes.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  The HPE Horzion plug-in consists of multiple tabs, each described in detail below:
  <h4><b>Configuration</b></h4>
  Use this panel to configure all of the features of the HPE Storage Horizon plug-in
  tool. This includes:
  <br>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li><b>Cinder node registration</b></li>
      Register Cinder nodes by supplying their node addresses, SSH
      credentials to access the node, and the path to the "cinder.conf"
      configuration file. This information is required to
      perform diagnostic tests and for discovering backend HPE storage arrays.
    <br>
    <li><b>Nova node registration (Optional)</b></li>
      Register Nova nodes by supplying their node addresses and the SSH
      credentials to access them. This information is required to perform diagnostic tests.
    <br>
    <li><b>Links between Cinder backends and HPE SSMC instances</b></li>
      Configure links between Cinder backends and HPE 3PAR StoreServ Management Console (SSMC)
      instances. Once created, any volume or snapshot hosted on the Cinder backend will have
      additional actions available in the Horizon Admin "Volumes" panel tables, including the
      ability to link directly to its associated volume/snapshot details panel in HPE SSMC.
      <br>
      This feature is especially critical because volume and snapshot names assigned in Horizon
      are not the names used when creating the object on the back-end storage array. This feature
      provides the only means to link the two names together.
  </ul>
  <h4><b>Diagnostic Tests</b></h4>
  Use this panel to perform diagnostic tests on registered Cinder and Nova nodes.
  <br>
  For Cinder nodes, the
  test consists of validating HPE related "cinder.conf" file settings, and verifying that the
  HPE 3PAR driver and other required software utilies are installed.
  <br>
  For Nova nodes, the
  test checks for the installation of required software utilities.
  <br>
  <h4><b>Storage Arrays</b></h4>
  Use this panel to view details on all discovered HPE storage arrays. Details include:
  <br>
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Array model type, serial number, OS and REST API (WSAPI) versions</li>
    <li>Array license information and how each relates to OpenStack features</li>
    <li>Storage pool capabilities</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><b>Volume Paths</b></h4>
  Use this panel to perform volume path queries on all registered Nova nodes.
  <br>
  For each registered Nova node, the query will return all active volume paths along with any
  associated volume names and ids. Results of the queries will be saved and can be compared
  against previous queries using the panels "Diff" feature. This can be very useful, for example,
  in determining if volume migration was completed successfully.

  <h2><span id="cinder_nodes_ref">Where to begin...</span></h2>
  <h4>To verify your OpenStack Cinder and Nova environment and discover HPE 3PAR backend
    storage arrays:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the "Configuration" tab and register all your Cinder and Nova nodes.</li>
    <li>Click the "Validate SSH Credentials" button to validate the registration
      information you entered is correct.</li>
    <li>Go to the "Diagnostic Tests" tab and run diagnostic tests on all of your
      registered Cinder and Nova nodes. An added feature of running diagnostic tests on
      Cinder nodes is the discovery of backend storage arrays.
    </li>
    <li>Go to the "Storage Arrays" tab to see what HPE 3PAR StoreServ arrays were discovered
      by the running of the Cinder diagnostic tests.</li>
  </ol>
  <h4>To add direct links from OpenStack volumes to associated HPE 3PAR SSMC detailed
    views:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to the "Configuration" tab and add links between Cinder backends and
      instances of HPE 3PAR SSMC.</li>
    <li>Go to the Admin -> Volumes panel to view additional actions associated
      with all volumes that were assigned to the Cinder backend specified in the
      previous step.</li>
    <li>Select one of the new actions to launch directly to the volumes
      associated views in HPE 3PAR SSMC.</li>
  </ol>
