Description
-----------

``utools`` is a Python 3 library that gather multiple useful functions
for various domains. Developers often have their own private tool
library; ``utools`` is just one of them being publicly released. It does
not claim to be exhaustive, always optimized and clearly implemented,
but it certainly does the job.

Most of the functions were specially designed to work with projects like
`Google Code Jam <https://code.google.com/codejam>`__ and
`ProjectEuler <https://projecteuler.net/>`__.

Even if ``utools`` is at first a personal collection of snippets, every
developer is invited to use it and contribute to its code.
