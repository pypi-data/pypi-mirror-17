DeepLearningStack
=======================

A project that helps develop deep learning models using Theano with xml configuration.

----

DeepLearningStack allows easy definition of deep neural networks with XML configuration files.
The package contains modules for definition of MLP, convolutional networks, reinforcement learning and recurrent neural networks.
