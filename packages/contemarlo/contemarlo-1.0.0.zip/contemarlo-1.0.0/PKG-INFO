        The concept is simple (and probably already done better): detailed Monte-Carlo
        but without the randomness or memory dependence.
        Despite the memory independence, generators default to safe mode not to flood memory.
        
        I to construct tests, so I know I don't break things.
        
        Classes:
            Resolver - A generator for the next distribution value pair
            Resolver_md - A multidimensional abstraction of Resolver
            Distribution - A distribution, domain [0,1]
