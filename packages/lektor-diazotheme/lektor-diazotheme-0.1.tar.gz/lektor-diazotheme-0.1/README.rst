Introduction
============

"What's Diazo?", I hear you say.  From `diazo.org <http://diazo.org>`_:

    Diazo allows you to apply a theme contained in a static HTML web
    page to a dynamic website created using any server-side
    technology. With Diazo, you can take an HTML wireframe created by
    a web designer and turn it into a theme for your favourite CMS,
    redesign the user interface of a legacy web application without
    even having access to the original source code, or build a unified
    user experience across multiple disparate systems, all in a matter
    of hours, not weeks.

    When using Diazo, you will work with syntax and concepts familiar
    from working with HTML and CSS. And by allowing you seamlessly
    integrate XSLT into your rule files, Diazo makes common cases
    simple and complex requirements possible.


A package to postprocess html artifacts with diazo
==================================================

This is a plugin for the `Lektor content management system`__ that
allows to postprocess any html file produced with a `Diazo theme`__,
allowing to transform the html as pleased and to share the theme
between many projects.
