# Laminate with Python

Laminate is a simple python package for creating beautiful print and html
documents from markdown.

All themes are HTML and CSS based and should use @print and advanced CSS3 for
css spesific for PDF generation.

This allows pdf documents to get a look and feel that is natural to printed
documents (page numbers, table of contents, references etc.). Yes! Dynamic page
numbers with CSS3!

While HTML documents use the default css that makes your documents shine when
distributed online.

**But why not use LaTeX:** LaTeX definitely has its uses, while flexible in
regards to scientific content, it is not easy to create or edit intricate
designs. Pluss designers are increasingly learning CSS and HTML, ebooks use
HTML and CSS under the hood, and it makes it easier to bridge the gap between
web and print media.
