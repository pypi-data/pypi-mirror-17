        OpenREM is a Django app to extract, store and export Radiation Exposure
        Monitoring related information, primarily from DICOM files.
        
        This is a beta release (0.7.4b1) containing a few essential fixes. Non-expert users should wait for the final release
        of 0.7.4. However, feedback from testers would be very useful.
        Please review the `release notes <http://docs.openrem.org/en/release-0.7.4b1/release-0.7.4.html>`_
        for details.

        might be broken. It can be found at http://djp-openremdemo.rhcloud.com/openrem/
