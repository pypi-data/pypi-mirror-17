OpenREM is a Django app to extract, store and export Radiation Exposure
Monitoring related information, primarily from DICOM files.

This is a beta release (0.7.4b1) containing a few essential fixes. Non-expert users should wait for the final release
of 0.7.4. However, feedback from testers would be very useful.

for details.

Full documentation can be found on Read the Docs: http://docs.openrem.org/en/release-0.7.4b1

Contribution of code, ideas, bug reports documentation is all welcome.
Please feel free to fork the repository and send me pull requests. See
`the website <http://openrem.org/getinvolved>`_ for more information.

There is a developer demo site, which at times has a working demo of recent code, but might not, and 
might be broken. It can be found at http://djp-openremdemo.rhcloud.com/openrem/
