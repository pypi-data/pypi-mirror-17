Description: 
        Python library for thermodynamics and other handy tools.
        
        
        Thermodynamics (all these properties as function of temperature for thousands
        of compounds):
        
        	- Specific heat capacity
        
        	- Enthalpy
        
        	- Entropy
        
        
        Temperature independent data:
        
        	- Molecular weight
        
        	- Enthalpy of formation
        
        
        and much more.
        
        For water pressure is also an input (higher accuracy).
        
        Modelling of chemical reactions is also present. Main features:
        
        	- Equilibrium constant as a function of temperature
        
        	- Heat of reaction as a function of temperature
        
        
        Handy tools:
        
        	- Units conversion module
        
        	- Hundreds of physical constants
        
        
        See the documentation for further details and examples.
