=================

ErrorPro allows to do calculations in IPython with physical quantities, which contain a value, error and unit.

It's features are:

* calculations with physical quantities including error propagation and SI unit propagation
* specifying your data in an intuitive physicist-oriented way
* calculating whole data sets at once (to a certain extend multi-dimensional)
* calculating weighted and unweighted mean values
* fitting curves to data (using scipy's curve_fit)
* plotting your data (using matplotlib)
* arranging your data nicely in HTML and LaTex tables
* showing the error formula and it's LaTex code
