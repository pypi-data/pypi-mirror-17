This is a python unit testing framework.
It is a re-implementation of ideas from the Voodoo-Mock unit-testing framework (http://sourceforge.net/projects/voodoo-mock), which also supports C++ unit testing.


I was introduced to the concepts of Mock Objects by the Voodoo Mock testing tool by S. Matichin. I was curious as to how it worked, but was impatient trying to decipher code I had not written, and so set out to write a similar framework for myself.
