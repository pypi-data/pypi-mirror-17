Description: ECS Deploy
        ==========
        An opinionated deployment application for ECS services.
        
        The stages of the deployment pipeline are:
        
        - test - The test environment represents the state of master in a git repository
            or the ``latest`` tag for a Docker image.
        - stage - The stage environment represents a tag in a git repository or a tagged
            revision of a Docker image.
        - production - The production environment is deployed using task definitions
            that were created in promoting ``test`` to ``stage``.
        
        ``ecs-deploy`` is used in the deployment pipeline for an ECS service. It expects
        a stable base task definition that is always running in the ``test``
        environment. This task definition should point to the ``latest`` tag for a
        Docker image.  If invoked for the ``test`` environment, ``ecs-deploy`` simply
        any running tasks.
        
        When invoked for the ``stage`` environment, the current task definition for
        the ``test`` environment is downloaded and modified to replace the ``latest``
        tag for the Docker image with the specified tag revision.
        
        When invoked for the ``production`` environment, it will update the service
        to use a task definition using the specified tag version.
