**jobcalc** aims to be a simple, but effective way at quickly calculating
job costs, using any combination of the following items.

* percentage profit margin
* hours and hourly rate
* percentage discounts
* monetary deductions

This project started one weekend, as I thought that I wish I had a simple, 
elegant, and flexible way to quickly calculate a job cost while still in
a terminal session, it grew from there to be extensible through custom
**Formatter's** to be able to be used in more than just a command line
application

Because of the use of type-hints, **python 3.5** or above are the only supported
versions for this package.  Sorry for this limitation, but this package is
also used in conjunction with a larger private project, where the type-hints
are handy.
