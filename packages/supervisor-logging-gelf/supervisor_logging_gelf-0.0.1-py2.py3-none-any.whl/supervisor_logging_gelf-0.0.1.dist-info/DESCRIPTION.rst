The Graylog server to send the events to is configured with the environment

You can set the variables up in the config below as well.

Add the plugin as an event listener in your main `supervisor.conf` of in a conf.d file like `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/logging.conf`:

```
[eventlistener:logging]
command = supervisor_logging_gelf
environment = GRAYLOG_SERVER=logs.myserver.com,GRAYLOG_PORT=12201
events = PROCESS_LOG
buffer_size = 1024
```

Enable the log events in your program:

```
[program:yourprogram]
stdout_events_enabled = true
stderr_events_enabled = true
```
