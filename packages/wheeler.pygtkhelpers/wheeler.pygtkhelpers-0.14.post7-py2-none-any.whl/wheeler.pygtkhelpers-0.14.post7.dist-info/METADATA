# Description #

PyGTKHelpers is a library to assist the building of PyGTK applications. It is
intentionally designed to be *non-frameworky*, and blend well with your
particular style of PyGTK development.

PyGTKHelpers provides a number of widespread features including: View
delegation, MVC, mixed GtkBuilder/Python views, widget proxying, signal
auto-connection, object-base lists and trees, a number of helper widgets,
utility functions for assisting creating new GObject types, unit testing
helpers and utilities to help debug PyGTK applications.
