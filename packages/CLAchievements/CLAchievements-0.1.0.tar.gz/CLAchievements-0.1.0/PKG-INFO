        Command line was all fun when it was invented fifty years ago, but it can no longer compete with modern interfaces, glowing windows, shiny buttons, and so on… Command Line Achievements (later abbreviated CLAchievements or CLA) aims to solve this, by making command line fun again! Inspired by video game achievements, it unlocks achievements when users meets the fulfillement conditions.
