# Tests

Tests run independently on each other, but not in a single python interpreter.
After each test a fresh `python` is required (it won't run as casual suite),
so either run them like this one by one:

    python test_<something>.py

or use [KivyUnitTest](https://github.com/KeyWeeUsr/KivyUnitTest) to do it
instead of you and better.
