Introduction to sgframework
===========================

Secure Gateway is a concept for an Internet Protocol (IP) based in-vehicle 
infotainment network, with a secure connection to the safety-critical vehicle 
network. This allows the user to install infotainment apps on the infotaiment 
head unit (IHU), without compromising the vehicle safety. 
The concept is also useful for example in industrial applications, 
where serial communication to industrial equipment must be protected, 
or in general for Internet-of-things (IoT) applications. 


This sgframework library is a Python package intended for implementing 
demonstration nodes in the suggested architecture.

There are several examples available, including examples running 
CAN (Controller Area Network) communication on embedded Linux boards 
(for example Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone).
