"""
sfc_models.examples package
===========================

Example code is deployed here.; currently only in the form of scripts in the "scripts" sub-package. Eventually,
will develop a deployment function to push the examples to a directory specified by the user.

The Quick2DPlot() function uses matlibplot, which is the only non-base library used. If matlibplot is
not installed, the plotting fails and gives the user a warning. The user can replace matlibplot with
another plotting package fairly easily, by replacing Quick2DPlot code with replacement code.
