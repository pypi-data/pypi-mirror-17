    * Added ability to *not* adjust the MIDIFile's time origin.
      Default behaviour is maintained, but will change in a future
      version (by default the origin is currently adjusted).
    * Changed the controller event parameter names to make them
      clearer.
    * Added support for Registered and Non-Registered parameter
      calls (``makeRPNCall`` and ``makeNRPNCall``).
    * General refactoring and clean-up.
    * Added function to select tuning program and bank.
      Some synthesizers, such as fluidsynth, require that
      uploaded tunings be explicitly assigned to a channel.
      This can be used after ``setNoteTuning`` in such a
      case.
    * Completed port to Python 3 / Unification of code base.
      Support for python < 2.6 has been dropped so that the
      Python 2 and 3 codebases could be unified.
    * Changes the way that sorting works, simplifying it and making
      it more expressive. The primary sort is on time; secondary on 
      ordinality for the event (which is user-definable, but defaults
      to an ordinality for the class); and the 
      third is the order in which the events were added.  Thus 
      is becomes easier to, say, make an RPN call, which entails 
      and ordered series of control change events all occurring at the 
      same time and of the same type.
    * Added 'annotation' as a parameter to note addition function. 
      This can be used to attach an arbitrary python object to the 
      note event. This is useful for extension development.

Date:       1 December 2013
Version:    0.89
    * Updated MIDIFile to support non-integral note values better.
    * Changed default temporal resolution to 960 ticks per beat.
    * Updated Python3 support. It is still somewhat experimental.
    * Misc. Bug Fixes.


Date:       20 October 2009
Version:    0.87

    First public release.

    * Tweaked email address in contact information.
    * Added/updated documentation.
    * Tweaked the setup.py file to produce better distributions.

Date:       9 October 2009
Version:    0.86

    * added addNote as main interface into package (not
      addNoteByNumber). It's been a while since I've cut a release,
      so there may be other things that have happened.

    * Created distutils package.

    * Minor code clean-up.

    * Added documentation in-line and in text (MIDIFile.txt).

    * All public functions should now be accessed thought
      MIDIFile directly, and not the component tracks.

Date:    15 January 2009
Version:    0.85

    * Split out from existing work as a separate project.
