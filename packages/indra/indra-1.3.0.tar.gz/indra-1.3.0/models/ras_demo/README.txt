Run RAS_build_model.py to create RAS_combined_model.pkl.

Once RAS_combined_model.pkl has been generated, one can run RAS_doseresp.py to
see the dynamics of ERK activity with respect to EGF, and RAS_mcmc.py to run
Bayesian parameter inference with respect to synthetic ERK activity data (this
requires bayessb).
