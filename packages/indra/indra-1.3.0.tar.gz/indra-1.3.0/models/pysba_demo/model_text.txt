The receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR binds the growth factor ligand EGF.
The EGFR-EGF complex binds another EGFR-EGF complex.
EGFR, bound to EGFR, transphosphorylates itself on a tyrosine residue.
The adaptor protein GRB2 can bind EGFR that is phosphorylated on tyrosine.
EGFR-bound GRB2 binds SOS1 and the SOS1-GRB2 complex binds HRAS.
HRAS, bound to SOS1, binds GTP.
HRAS, bound to GTP, binds RAF1.
RAF1, bound to HRAS, phosphorylates itself at Thr491 and Ser494.
RAF1 phosphorylated at Thr491 and Ser494 is activated.
Active RAF1 phosphorylates MEK1 at Ser218 and Ser222.
MEK1 phosphorylated at Ser218 and Ser222 is activated.
Active MEK1 phosphorylates ERK2 at Tyr187 and Thr185.
