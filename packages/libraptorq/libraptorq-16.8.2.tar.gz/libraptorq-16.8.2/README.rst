python-libraptorq
=================

Python 2.X CFFI_ bindings for libRaptorQ_ - C++11 implementation of RaptorQ
Forward Error Correction codes, as described in RFC6330_.

**WARNING**: This module is very poorly-tested and seem to have bugs that lead
to actual (and random) data corruption (!!!), see e.g.
`github-issue-1 <https://github.com/mk-fg/python-libraptorq/issues/1>`_.
Please DO NOT USE IT for anything but idle tinkering.

**Warning**: as far as I know (not a lawyer), there are lots of patents around
the use of this technology, which might be important for any high-profile and
commercial projects, especially in US and Canada.

General info
------------

Quoting `wikipedia on Raptor code`_:

  Raptor codes, as with fountain codes in general, encode a given message
  consisting of a number of symbols, k, into a potentially limitless sequence of
  encoding symbols such that knowledge of any k or more encoding symbols allows
  the message to be recovered with some non-zero probability.

  Raptor ("RAPid TORnado") codes are the first known class of fountain codes
  with linear time encoding and decoding.

And RFC6330_:

  RaptorQ codes are a new family of codes that provide superior flexibility,
  support for larger source block sizes, and better coding efficiency than
  Raptor codes in RFC 5053.

  ... in most cases, a set of cardinality equal to the number of source symbols
  is sufficient; in rare cases, a set of cardinality slightly more than the
  number of source symbols is required.

In practice this means that source data block of size 1 MiB (for example) can
(with very high probability) be recovered from any 1.002 MiB of the received
symbols for it (from `"Application Layer Forward Error Correction for Mobile
Multimedia Broadcasting Case Study" paper`_).

Note that being a probablilistic algorithm, RaptorQ can have highly-improbable
pathological cases and be exploited through these e.g. by dropping specific data
blocks (see `"Stopping a Rapid Tornado with a Puff" paper`_ for more details).

| Whole input can have up to 256 "source blocks" (encoded independently).
| Each block can have up to 56.403 symbols.
| Each symbol can be up to 65.535 (2**16 - 1) bytes long.
| This sums up to ~881 GiB max for one encoder input.
|

Encoded data will be roughly same size as original plus the "repair symbols",
i.e. almost no size overhead, except for what is intentionally generated.

Usage
-----

Module includes command-line script ("rq", when installed or as symlink in the
repo), which has example code for both encoding and decoding, and can be used as
a standalone tool, or for basic algorithm testing/showcase.

Can also be used from command-line via ``python2 -m libraptorq ...`` invocation
(when installed as module), e.g. ``python2 -m libraptorq --help``.

Command-line script
'''''''''''''''''''

To encode file, with 50% extra symbols (resulting indivisible data chunks to be
stored/transmitted intact or lost entirely) and 30% of total from these (K
required symbols + X repair symbols) dropped (just for testing purposes) before
saving them to "setup.py.enc"::

  % ./rq --debug encode --repair-symbols-rate 0.5 --drop-rate 0.3 setup.py setup.py.enc
  2016-02-25 03:21:09 :: DEBUG :: Encoded 1,721 B into 168 symbols\
    (needed: >108, repair rate: 50%), 48 dropped (30%), 120 left in output (1,920 B without ids)

Decode original file back from these::

  % ./rq --debug decode setup.py.enc setup.py.dec
  2016-02-25 03:21:34 :: DEBUG :: Decoded 1,721 B of data\
    from 108 processed symbols (1,728 B without ids, symbols total: 120)

  % sha256sum -b setup.py{,.dec}
  36c50348459b51821a2715b0f5c4ef08647d66f77a29913121af4f0f4dfef454 *setup.py
  36c50348459b51821a2715b0f5c4ef08647d66f77a29913121af4f0f4dfef454 *setup.py.dec

No matter which chunks are dropped (get picked by ``random.choice``), file
should be recoverable from output as long as number of chunks left (in each
"block") is slightly (by ~0.02%) above K.

Output data ("setup.py.enc" in the example) for the script is JSON-encoded list
of base64-encoded symbols, as well as some parameters for lib init
(``oti_scheme``, ``oti_common``) and input data length.

See output with --help option for all the other script parameters.

Python module
'''''''''''''

To use as a python2 module::

  from libraptorq import RQEncoder

  data = 'some input string' * 500

  # Data size must be divisible by RQEncoder.data_size_div
  data_len, n = len(data), RQEncoder.data_size_div
  if data_len % n: data += '\0' * (n - data_len % n)

  with RQEncoder(data, min_subsymbol_size=4, symbol_size=16, max_memory=200) as enc:

    symbols = dict()
    oti_scheme, oti_common = enc.oti_scheme, enc.oti_common

    for block in enc:
      symbols.update(block.encode_iter(repair_rate=0))

  data_encoded = data_len, oti_scheme, oti_common, symbols

``oti_scheme`` and ``oti_common`` are two integers specifying encoder options,
needed to initialize decoder, which can be hard-coded (if constant) on both ends.

``block.encode_iter()`` can be used without options to produce max possible
amount of symbols, up to ``block.symbols + block.max_repair``.
Above example only produces K symbols - min amount required.

For decoding (reverse operation)::

  from libraptorq import RQDecoder

  data_len, oti_scheme, oti_common, symbols = data_encoded

  with RQDecoder(oti_scheme, oti_common) as dec:
    for sym_id, sym in symbols.viewitems(): dec.add_symbol(sym, sym_id)

    data = dec.decode()[:data_len]

Note that in practice, e.g. when transmitting each symbol in a udp packet, one'd
want to send something like ``sym_id || sym_data || checksum``, and keep sending
these from ``block.encode_iter()`` until other side acknowledges that it can
decode a block (i.e. enough symbols received, see ``RQDecoder.decode_block()``),
then start streaming the next block in similar fashion.

See `__main__.py
<https://github.com/mk-fg/python-libraptorq/blob/master/libraptorq/__main__.py>`_
file (cli script) for an extended example, and libRaptorQ_ docs for info on its
C API, which this module wraps around.



Installation
------------

It's a regular package for Python 2.7 (not 3.X).

It uses and needs CFFI_ (can/should be installed by pip_) and libRaptorQ_
installed (as libRaptorQ.so) on the system.

Using pip_ is the best way::

  % pip install libraptorq

If you don't have it, use::

  % easy_install pip
  % pip install libraptorq

Alternatively (see also `pip2014.com`_ and `pip install guide`_)::

  % curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python2
  % pip install libraptorq

Or, if you absolutely must::

  % easy_install libraptorq

But, you really shouldn't do that.

Current-git version can be installed like this::

  % pip install 'git+https://github.com/mk-fg/python-libraptorq.git#egg=libraptorq'

Note that to install stuff in system-wide PATH and site-packages, elevated
privileges are often required.
Use "install --user", `~/.pydistutils.cfg`_ or virtualenv_ to do unprivileged
installs into custom paths.

Alternatively, ``./rq`` tool can be run right from the checkout tree without any
installation, if that's the only thing you need there.

Random Notes
------------

* libRaptorQ is currently used via CFFI in "ABI Mode" to avoid any extra hassle
  with compilation and the need for compiler, see `CFFI docs on the subject`_
  for more info on what it means.

* When decoding, libRaptorQ can raise errors for ``add_symbol()`` calls, when
  source block is already decoded and that extra symbol is not needed.

* libRaptorQ allows to specify "rq_type" parameter for internal data alignment
  size (C++ iterator element), which is hard-coded to RQ_ENC_32/RQ_DEC_32
  in the module, for simplicity.

* Lack of Python 3.X compatibility is due to me not using it at all (yet?), so
  don't need it, have nothing against it in principle.
