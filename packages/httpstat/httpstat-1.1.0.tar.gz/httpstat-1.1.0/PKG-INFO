        httpstat is a **single file🌟** Python script that has **no dependency👏** and is compatible with **Python 3🍻**.
        
        > httpstat is designed to be a single file script so that it could be used
        > or ported easily in any platform, but if you really like it and want
        > to install `httpstat` as a command, well, here you go: `pip install httpstat`
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Just pass a url with it:
        
        ```bash
        python httpstat.py httpbin.org/get
        ```
        
        By default it will write response body in a tempfile, but you can let it print out by setting `HTTPSTAT_SHOW_BODY=true`:
        
        ```bash
        HTTPSTAT_SHOW_BODY=true python httpstat.py httpbin.org/get
        ```
        
        You can pass any curl supported arguments after the url (except for `-w`, `-D`, `-o`, `-s`, `-S` which are already used by httpstat):
        
        ```bash
        HTTPSTAT_SHOW_BODY=true python httpstat.py httpbin.org/post -X POST --data-urlencode "a=中文" -v
        ```
