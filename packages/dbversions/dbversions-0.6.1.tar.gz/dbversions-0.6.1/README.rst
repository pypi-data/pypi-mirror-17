 **dbversions** - Database Versioning with Git
===============================================
 
**dbversions** is a python software package which helps to keep distinct 
database versions for various branches and commits of a git repository.

The different versions are kept by database dumps at specific commits and 
databases are brought up to the latest status by executing the db scripts
committed within a specific branch.
