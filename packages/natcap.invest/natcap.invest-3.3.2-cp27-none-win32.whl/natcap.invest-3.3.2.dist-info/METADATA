        About  InVEST
        =============
        
        InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) is a family
        of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and
        practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in
        nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to
        quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify
        the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with
        alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.
        
        Older versions of InVEST ran as script tools in the ArcGIS ArcToolBox environment,
        but have almost all been ported over to a purely open-source python environment.
        
        InVEST is licensed under a permissive, modified BSD license.

        Installing InVEST
        =================
        
        Python Dependencies
        -------------------
        
        Dependencies for ``natcap.invest`` are listed in ``requirements.txt``:
        
        .. These dependencies are listed here statically because when I push the
           readme page to PyPI, they won't render if I use the .. include::
           directive.  Annoying, but oh well.  It just means that we'll need to
           periodically check that this list is accurate.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            Pyro4>=4.41
            gdal>=1.11.2,<2.0
            matplotlib
            natcap.versioner>=0.4.2
            numpy>=1.11.0
            pyamg>=2.2.1
            pygeoprocessing>=0.3.0a22
            rtree>=0.8.2
            scipy>=0.16.1
            shapely
            setuptools>=8.0
        
        Additionally, ``PyQt4`` is required to use the ``invest`` cli, but is not
        required for development against ``natcap.invest``.
        
        Installing from Source
        ----------------------
        
        If you have a compiler installed and configured for your system, and
        dependencies installed, the easiest way to install InVEST as a python package 
        is:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install natcap.invest
        
        If you are working within virtual environments, there is a `documented issue
        with namespaces 
        <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issues/250/develop-and-install-single-version>`__
        in setuptools that may cause problems when importing packages within the
        ``natcap`` namespace.  The current workaround is to use these extra pip flags:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install natcap.invest --egg --no-binary :all:
        
        Installing the latest development version
        -----------------------------------------
        
        The latest development version of InVEST can be installed from our source tree:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/natcap/invest@develop
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To run an InVEST model from the command-line, use the ``invest`` cli single
        entry point:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ invest --help
            usage: invest [-h] [--version] [--list] [model]

            positional arguments:
              model       The model/tool to run. Use --list to show available
                          models/tools. Identifiable model prefixes may also be used.
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help  show this help message and exit
              --version   show program's version number and exit
              --list      List available models
        
        To list the available models:
        
        .. code-block:: console 
        
            $ invest --list
