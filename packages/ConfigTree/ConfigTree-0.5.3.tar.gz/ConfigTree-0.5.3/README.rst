ConfigTree
==========

Configuration files behave like cancer tumor.  As soon as one is created with a
handful of parameters, it starts to grow.  And in a couple of month it becomes
huge hardly supportable monster with dozens of parameters, which affects on
different subsystems of the project like metastasis.

The goal of ConfigTree project is to restrain the monster, but without
overkill for small projects.  It can be used in Python programs as well as in
programs written in other languages.

ConfigTree will be useful for you, if you want to:

*   keep default configuration options and environment-specific ones
    separated;
*   fine-tune files to load for each environment;
*   validate configuration;
*   have templates and automation in your configuration files.
