        Python package for NAVER English-Korean and Korean-English dictionaries
        
        ## Introduction
        Search of both English-Korean and Korean-English dictionaries is provided.
        
        ## Requirements
        Ndic works by crawling the web <http://endic.naver.com/>. To crawl, it uses [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
        
        Therefore, you should use it in **Internet Environments**.
        
        Ndic supports Python 2.6–2.7 & 3.3–3.5 because [Requests officially supports these versions.](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests#feature-support)
        
        ## Installation
        Install via pip:
        
        ```
        $ pip install ndic
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        The usage is very simple.
        
        ```
        >>> import ndic
        ```
        Entering an English word as the function argument will return the corresponding Korean word(s).
        
        ```
        >>> ndic.search('apple')
        '사과'
        ```
        Conversely, entering a Korean word as the function argument will return the corresponding English word(s).
        
        ```
        >>> ndic.search('안녕하세요')
        'Hi!'
        ```
        Phrases or words may also be searched.
        
        ```
        >>> ndic.search('in order to')
        '(목적) 위하여'
        ```
        
        Entering a nonexistent word as the function argument will return the empty string.
        
        ```
        >>> ndic.search("aslkjfwe")
        ''
        >>> ndic.search("아댜리야")
        ''
        ```
        
        If your network connection is lost, you will get below error message.
        
        ```
        >>> ndic.search('...')
        NdicConnectionError: Network connection is lost. Please check the connection to the Internet.
        ```
        
        ## Command Line Interface
        Furthermore, Ndic supports CLI(Command Line System). So you can use it in command line and get the return value of Ndic in terminals. It works by [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/).
        
        ```
        $ ndic love
        (특히 가족・친구에 대한) 사랑
        ```
