Description: tdxutil: small tools for working with datatypes, data, and exceptions
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        In `collections.py` there are some tools for working with lists,
        sets, dicts, and iterables more declaratively.
        
        In `data.py` there are some functiions to more concisely read and
        write yaml in the most common use cases.
        
        In `exceptions.py` there are some error handling tools. See the
        `calldecorators` package if you'd prefer to have a decorator
        api.
