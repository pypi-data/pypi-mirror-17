scriptler
=========

Scriptler allows you to manage scripts from different sources in one place with a simple configuration file.

installation
------------

As usual, use pip to install::

    $ pip install --user scriptler

usage
-----

First off, create a configuration file in ~/.config/scriptler/config::

    [scriptler]
    script_dir = ~/.local/share/scriptler

    [afriemann/scripts.git]
    url = github.com/AFriemann/scripts
    branch = master

    [scripts]
    socksme = ~/git/scripts/bash/socksme
    proxy-foxy = ~/git/scripts/bash/proxy-foxy
    swap = afriemann/scripts.git:bin/swap

The only thing of note is that the section scripts is reserved for the actual scripts. Repository sections may be
named however you please.
The `scriptler` section is not required (~/.local/share/scriptler is the default) but should be something you have
write access to and can add to your $PATH.

To install the scripts, simply run::

    $ scriptler update
    installing socksme
    installing swap
    installing proxy-foxy
    removing unmanaged file foobar

This will also remove unmanaged files (those that you removed from your configuration file/never added).

And to remove them again::

    $ scriptler remove
    removing swap
    removing proxy-foxy
    removing socksme

To get a nice list of currently installed scripts::

    $ scriptler status
    config file  ~/.config/scriptler/config
    script dir   ~/.local/share/scriptler

    script        managed
    ----------  ---------
    swap                1
    proxy-foxy          1
    socksme             1

todo
----

* scriptler will ruthlessly reinstall files. Right now I don't care, but it would probably be better to change that
* the only sources supported right now are github and local files
