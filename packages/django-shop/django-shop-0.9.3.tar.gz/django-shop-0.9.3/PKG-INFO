        Version 0.9 of **django-SHOP** is a complete rewrite of the old code
        base but keeps the concepts of model overriding and cart modifiers.
        Therefore with some effort, it should be possible to migrate existing
        projects to this new release. Please contact me, if you need help.

        Running the demo projects
        -------------------------
        
        To get a first impression on **django-SHOP**, try out the three full
        working demo projects.
        
        And remember, I'm always happy to get some feedback on how it works
        elsewhere.
        
        Run the demo in a local virtualenv
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Following the instructions ``docs/tutorial/intro.rst`` and
        ``docs/tutorial/quickstart.rst`` should create a running shop in
        minutes, prefilled with a dozen of products. You can even pay by credit
        card, if you apply for your own testing account at Stripe.
        
        Run the demo using Docker
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A faster alternative to run the "polymorphic" demo of **django-SHOP** is
        to use a prepared Docker container available on the `Docker
        Hub <https://hub.docker.com/r/awesto/demo-shop-polymorphic/>`__. If you
        have a running docker-machine, download and start the demo using:
        
        ::
        
            docker run -p 9001:9001 --rm awesto/demo-shop-polymorphic:latest
        
        Then point a browser on the IP address of your docker machine onto port
        9001. If unsure invoke ``docker-machine ip``. This could for instance be
        http://192.168.99.100:9001/ . To access the backend sign in with
        username *admin* and password *secret*. The first invocation of each
        page takes some time, since beforehand the supplied images have to be
        thumbnailed.
        
        Current Status of Django-SHOP
        -----------------------------
        
        This version of django-SHOP is currently used to implement real
        e-commerce sites. If you want to help out, please have a look at our
        development documentation in ``docs/contributing.rst``.
        
        **Django-SHOP** aims to be a the easy, fun and fast shop counterpart to
        django CMS.
        
        Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and
        Pythonic/Djangonic implementation of a shop framework, that a moderately
        experienced Django programmer should be able to pick up and run easily.
        
        Please help
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        In order to build better demo sites, we need good pictures together with
        some introductory text for arbitrary products. Both, pictures and text
        must be free of copyright or under an open license (CC-by-SA, or
        similar). If you can provide these assets, please get in touch with
        Jacob Rief or Ren√© Fleschenberg by email.
        
        We also need ... \* more tests. \* translations into other natural
        languages. \* a native English speaker to check the documentation.
