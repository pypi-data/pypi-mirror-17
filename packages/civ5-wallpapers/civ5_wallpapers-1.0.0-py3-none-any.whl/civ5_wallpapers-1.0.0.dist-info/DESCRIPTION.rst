`Sid Meier's Civilization V`_ is a great turn-based strategy game, and it comes
with a bunch of great paintings, spread all around the game. This tool allows
you to extract those, and to use them as your wallpaper for your favourite
Linux distro.

**You must have a legit copy of Civilization V installed on your computer to
use this program.**
