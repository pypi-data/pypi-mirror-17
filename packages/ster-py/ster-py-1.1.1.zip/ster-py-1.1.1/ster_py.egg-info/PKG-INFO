        --------------
        
        Sidenote
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        This is a weird python program. The only reason this exists is because
        sterkinekor have generously(?) left all their xml feeds open. The ones I
        used in particular are:
        
        ``http://www.sterkinekor.com/website/scripts/xml_feed.php?name=movies``
        
        ``http://www.sterkinekor.com/website/scripts/xml_feed.php?name=cinemas``
        
        ``http://www.sterkinekor.com/website/scripts/xml_feed.php?name=hashcheck_app_android_v2``
        
        ``http://www.sterkinekor.com/scripts/xml_feed.php?name=performance&movie_id=x``
        
        It's pretty cool that all of this data is available, even including a
        hash of the xml files. So I thought I might as well take advantage of
        that; especially because of how much I hate their website :)
        
        Also this is the first time I've ever released a python package on PyPi
        so if i've made any obvious mistakes, well anywhere, please tell me!
