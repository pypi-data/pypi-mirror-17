cmd2 can be installed from PyPI by ``easy_install`` or ``pip``.

Development trunk can be downloaded with mercurial::

  hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/python-cmd2

To install from the trunk, ``cd python-cmd2`` and run ``python setup.py install`` or ``python setup.py develop`` (requires setuptools).  (Use ``root`` account, or ``sudo``, on *nix.)

Python 3
--------

The Python 3 egg downloaded from PyPI or installed by ``pip`` or ``easy_install`` is ready to go.

To install from source for Python 3, the 2to3 transformations must be applied to ``cmd2.py``.
The best way to do this is to install ``distribute`` on Python 3 before installing
``cmd1``::

  curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
  sudo python3 distribute_setup.py

  sudo python3 setup.py install

2to3 won't run if there's a ``build`` directory that's newer than your source code.  Deleting the ``cmd2/build`` directory before running setup.py ensures that this won't be a problem.
