        How to use it?
        --------------
        
        First you will have to map tryton employee with quickbooks source name.
        Go to ``Party >> Configuration >> Companies >> Employees``
        
        .. image:: images/employee.png
        
        Map accounts with quickbooks payroll item,
        ``Financial >> Configuration >> Quickbooks Payroll``
        
        .. image:: images/payroll.png
        
        Now go to Import Payroll Items wizard (``Financial >> Entries >> Import Payroll Items``), choose Credit Account,
        account which will have effective balance and and click the search icon to select
        the csv file of quickbooks payroll entries from your computer.
        
        .. image:: images/import_wizard.png
        
        This creates an account move corresponding to payroll entries in csv. For
        now it can only import one payroll entry at a time!
