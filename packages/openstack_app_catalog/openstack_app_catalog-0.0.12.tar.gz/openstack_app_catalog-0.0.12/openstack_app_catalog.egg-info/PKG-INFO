        ===============================
        Application Catalog for OpenStack
        
        The OpenStack Community App Catalog will help you make
        applications available on your OpenStack cloud by providing
        a community driven catalog containing Glance images, Heat
        templates and Murano applications.
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        By providing a public location where OpenStack users can
        publish and consume artifacts to share and add additional
        capabilities, all OpenStack clouds become more valuable. For
        example vendors can publish Glance images for launching new
        VMs, Heat templates for creating new stacks, or Murano app
        packages for installing complete applications. When many
        OpenStack community members are publishing artifacts that
        users can easily download and install into their clouds this
        will multiply the value of their OpenStack cloud. Easy
        access to images, templates and apps will solve the "what
        now" question some user consider after successfully
        deploying an OpenStack environment.
