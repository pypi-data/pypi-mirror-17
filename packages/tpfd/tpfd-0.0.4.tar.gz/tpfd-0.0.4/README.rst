=======================================

**TPFD** is an easy way to parse strings and execute functions depending on their contents.  

Inspired by `flask <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask>`_ and using `parse <https://github.com/r1chardj0n3s/parse>`_ under the hood, this allows you to decorate functions with grammar rules and if a pattern that matches one of your grammar rules is found, the function will be run with a set of keyword arguments you've specified passed to it!  Great for parsing logs and executing macros on what it finds! 

Examples
--------
.. code-block:: python

    Aniamls.txt
    Turtles are cool
    Sloths are cool
    Mosquitos are dumb

    >>> p  = tpfd.Parser()

    >>> @p.on_recognize('{Animal} are cool')
        def main(animal):
            print('I like {0}.'.format(animal))
    
    >>> p.parse_file('animals.txt')
    'I like turtles.'
    'I like sloths.'

    >>> p.iter_parse(['Turtles are cool', 'Sloths are cool', 'Mosquitos are dumb'])
    'I like turtles.'
    'I like sloths.'
	
    >>> p.parse_string('Sloths are cool')
    'I like sloths.'
	
    >>> p.parse_string('Mosquitos are dumb')
    None

To Install
----------

::

    $ pip install tpfd

Notes
-----
Any format spec supported by parse is supported by this library since it's all parse under the hood.  
Example: ``{[field name]:[format spec]}``

Current Features
----------------

* Support for parsing text files
* Support for accepting generators that output text.


TODO
----
* Support streams
* various built in converters to translate numbers/day names/dates
