Python containers with persistency

|landscape| |travis| |codecov|

`pysistency` provides clones of standard containers backed by persistent data
storage. These containers allow to wrk with data too large for memory, and to
seamlessly keep data across program executions.

Containers
==========

Efficiently implementing each container requires code tailored to its data
structure and usage. Each implementation is developed separately from others.

================ =========================================== ==============
Python           Pysistency                                   Status
================ =========================================== ==============
`dict` `pysistency.pdict.PersistentDict`  Stable
`list` `pysistency.plist.PersistentList`  Experimental
================ =========================================== ==============

The following `Status` categories are used:

**Experimental**
    Public interfaces and data storage may change at any time. Functionality
    is lacking.

**Stable**
    Core functionality fully implemented, data storage will remain stable.
    Some functionality still missing.

**Complete**
    All functionality available. Internal implementation details may change.

**Done**
    All functionality available, internal implementation stable, passes all
    applicable, official tests.

Where's X?
==========

Priority for new/existing types depends mostly on ease of implementation and
need. If you require a specific type or interface, let me know.

Backends
========

The containers of `pysistency` rely on backends to store data. This allows
switching the storage backend for each container. Currently, there is only
one backend: a file-based backend using `pickle`.
