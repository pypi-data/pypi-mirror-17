Changes
~~~~~~~

  [Hank Gay]

Fix
~~~

- Fix Seconds Behind Master metric (it was trying to use wrong status
  info as datasource). [Hank Gay]

- Stop manually associating mysql subgroup to cwmon group. [Hank Gay]

  The click-plugins library is already taking care of that for me.
  Removing the code that attempts to make the association manually causes
  the subgroup to start loading properly.
