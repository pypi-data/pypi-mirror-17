    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lstn/ip6words/master/usage.gif" alt="Gif usage examples">
</p>

```bash
# Script entry point "ip6words" can be used instead of manually launching the script through python if the package was installed.
$ ip6words :: 
the8

$ ip6words -h
Usage:
        python ip6words.py ([-h] | [-d] | [-u] | [-e]) (<ip6words-address-to-convert> | <ipv6-to-convert>)
         [-h] ~ This dialog
         [-u] ~ The usage dialog
         [-d] ~ Delete the dilled (pickled) word list in order to regenerate it before executing
		 [-e] ~ Explode the results instead of compressing them
```

#### Install

```bash
pip install ip6words
```

#### Requirements

- Python 3.3+ (NOT tested at all on Python 2)
- nltk <sub>(*will download these packages on first run that doesn't use dill, download them yourself beforehand if you'd like to choose the download directory*)</sub>
 + words - <sub>*optional* ~ see note #3</sub>
 + brown - <sub>*optional* ~ see note #3</sub>
 + abc - <sub>*optional* ~ see note #3</sub>
 + inaugural - <sub>*optional* ~ see note #3</sub>
 + genesis - <sub>*optional* ~ see note #3</sub>
- dill


#### Notes

1. This is designed to have the same words always point to the same IP and vice versa. The only thing that
would alter this would be a change in the base nltk data, causing a shift in the frequency of words.
2. Included with this tool is a dilled (or pickled) word list. If you wish to re-generate that dill you
must delete the file or run using the \[-d] argument.
3. In practice, this means you will actually never have to download the nltk packages yourself if you never
use the \[-d] argument and thus always load the wordlist from the dill.
