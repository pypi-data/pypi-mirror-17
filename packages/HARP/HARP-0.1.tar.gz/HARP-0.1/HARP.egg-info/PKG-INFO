Description: #####################################
        HARP - CLI tool for parsing HAR files
        #####################################
        
        CLI tool to parse and analyze `HTTP Archive (HAR)`_ files.
        
        .. _HTTP Archive (HAR): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har
        
        
        (Planned) features
        ==================
        
        - List / filter requests contained in the archive
        - Replay a specific given request
          - And analyze differences between subsequent responses
        - Print differences between requests in the file
        - Replay modified requests and see how that affects the response
        
        
        Main use cases
        ==============
        
        There might be many, but in my specific case I need to analyze the
        behavior of (overly complex!) search forms for crawling purposes, see
        how requests are made, and which parts of the request will affect the
        response.
