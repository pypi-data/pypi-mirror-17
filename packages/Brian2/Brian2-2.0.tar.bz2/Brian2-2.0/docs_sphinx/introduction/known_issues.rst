Cannot find msvcr90d.dll
------------------------

If you see this message coming up, find the file
``PythonDir\Lib\site-packages\numpy\distutils\mingw32ccompiler.py``
and modify the line ``msvcr_dbg_success = build_msvcr_library(debug=True)`` to read
``msvcr_dbg_success = False`` (you can comment out the existing line and add the new line
immediately after).

"Missing compiler_cxx fix for MSVCCompiler"
-------------------------------------------

If you keep seeing this message, do not worry. It's not possible for us to
hide it, but doesn't indicate any problems.

Problems with numerical integration
-----------------------------------

In some cases, the automatic choice of numerical integration method will not be
appropriate, because of a choice of parameters that couldn't be determined in
advance. In this case, typically you will get nan (not a number) values in the
results, or large oscillations. In this case, Brian will generate a warning to
let you know, but will not raise an error.
