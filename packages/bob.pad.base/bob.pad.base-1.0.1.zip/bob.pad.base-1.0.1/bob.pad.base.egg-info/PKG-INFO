        ========================================
        Scripts to run anti-spoofing experiments
        ========================================
        
        This package is part of the ``bob.pad`` packages, which allow to run comparable and reproducible presentation attack detection (PAD) experiments on publicly available databases.
        
        This package contains basic functionality to run PAD experiments.
        It provides a generic ``./bin/spoof.py`` script that takes several parameters, including:
        
        * A database and its evaluation protocol
        * A data preprocessing algorithm
        * A feature extraction algorithm
        * A PAD algorithm
        
        All these steps of the PAD system are given as configuration files.
        
        In this base class implementation, only a core functionality is implemented. The specialized algorithms should be provided by other packages, which are usually in the ``bob.pad`` namespace, such as:
        
        * `bob.pad.voice for speech-related PAD algorithms
