    The given ``extractor`` is used to extract all features required for the current experiment.

    By default, if target files already exist, they are not re-created.

    The preprocessor is only used to load the data in a coherent way.

    **Parameters:**

    extractor : py:class:`bob.bio.base.extractor.Extractor` or derived
      The extractor, used for extracting and writing the features.

    preprocessor : py:class:`bob.bio.base.preprocessor.Preprocessor` or derived
      The preprocessor, used for reading the preprocessed data.

    groups : some of ``('train', 'dev', 'eval')`` or ``None``
      The list of groups, for which the data should be extracted.

    indices : (int, int) or None
      If specified, only the features for the given index range ``range(begin, end)`` should be extracted.
      This is usually given, when parallel threads are executed.

    force : bool
