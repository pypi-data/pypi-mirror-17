    Initialise a Regina python session.

                     otherwise be written to standard output.  If an error
                     occurs, details of the error will be written regardless.
        readline   : If true, attempt to enable tab completion.
        libs       : If true, execute all of the user's start-up libraries
                     in the global namespace.
        snappyPath : Applies to platforms where SnapPy might not be installed
                     on the python path (e.g., MacOS users with the SnapPy app
                     bundle).  If true, this setup routine will (i) attempt
                     to locate SnapPy, and (ii) if successful, extend sys.path
                     to include the location of SnapPy's python module and its
                     dependencies.
        banner     : If true, print a welcome banner to standard output.
        namespace  : The global namespace in which the start-up library scripts
                     (if any) will be executed.  This may be None, in which
                     case the caller's global namespace will be used.
        builtinOpen: If true, sets "open" in the given namespace to Python's
                     builtin open() function.  This is used to work around the
                     problem whereby "from regina import *", overrides Python's
                     open() function with Regina's.  You will still be able to
                     access Regina's open() function by calling regina.open().
                     If the namespace argument above is None, then this option
                     has no effect.
