 * This class offers routines for constructing sample 2-manifold triangulations
 * of various types.  These triangulations may be useful for testing new
 * code, or for simply getting a feel for how Regina works.
 *
 * The sample triangulations offered here may prove especially useful in
 * Regina's scripting interface, where working with pre-existing files
 * is more complicated than in the GUI.
 *
 * All of the methods in this class will assign an appropriate packet label
 * to the triangulation that they return.
 *
 * Note that each of these routines constructs a new triangulation from
 * scratch.  It is up to the caller of each routine to destroy the
 * triangulation that is returned.
