Albatross
=========

A modern, fast, simple, natively-async web framework. (Python3.5 only)

.. code:: python

    from albatross import Server
    import asyncio


    class Handler:
        async def on_get(self, req, res):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
            res.write('Hello, %s' % req.args['name'])


    app = Server()
    app.add_route('/{name})', Handler())
    app.serve()

Notes for Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For now (pre 1.0.0), I'm making no claims about API stability (but will
try to avoid changes). That said, I'm using this framework for some
small projects, and it is a joy to work in! Reach out if you want to use
this, as I'm happy to incorporate your feedback!

Install
-------

::

    pip3 install albatross3

Features
--------

-  You can read the entire codebase in about 30 minutes.

-  It's natively async. Doing ``await`` database calls or controller
   calls in your views just works!

-  This works with the ``uvloop`` project, to make your server fast!

Benchmarks
----------

-  My benchmarks indicate that albatross is as fast as aiohttp, both of
   which are twice as fast as tornado. You can run the benchmarks by
   poking around in the ``bench/`` folder.
