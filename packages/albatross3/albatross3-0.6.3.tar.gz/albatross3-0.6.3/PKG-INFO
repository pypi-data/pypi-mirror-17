        Albatross
        =========
        
        A modern, fast, simple, natively-async web framework. (Python3.5 only)
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from albatross import Server
            import asyncio
        
        
            class Handler:
                async def on_get(self, req, res):
                    await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
                    res.write('Hello, %s' % req.args['name'])
        
        
            app = Server()
            app.add_route('/{name})', Handler())
            app.serve()
        
        Notes for Usage
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        For now (pre 1.0.0), I'm making no claims about API stability (but will
        try to avoid changes). That said, I'm using this framework for some
        small projects, and it is a joy to work in! Reach out if you want to use
        this, as I'm happy to incorporate your feedback!
        
        Install
        -------
        
        ::
        
            pip3 install albatross3
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  You can read the entire codebase in about 30 minutes.
        
        -  It's natively async. Doing ``await`` database calls or controller
           calls in your views just works!
        
        -  This works with the ``uvloop`` project, to make your server fast!
        
        Benchmarks
        ----------
        
        -  My benchmarks indicate that albatross is as fast as aiohttp, both of
           which are twice as fast as tornado. You can run the benchmarks by
           poking around in the ``bench/`` folder.
