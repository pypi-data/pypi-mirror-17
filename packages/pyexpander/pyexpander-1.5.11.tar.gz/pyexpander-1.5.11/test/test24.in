Here is a test of evaluation of empty loops and variable scopes.  The following
code shows a simple loop with an if block in it:

$for(i in range(3))\
i==$(i) --> \
$if(i<1)\
smaller than 1
$elif(i==1)\
equal to 1
$else\
bigger than 1
$endif\
$endfor\

Now the same code but this time the loop is not executed since we do 
\$for(j in range(0)). Since the loop is not executed the variable \$(j) is not
defined. pyexpander *must not* evaluate the if conditions since this would lead
to an exception. The following code should just generate empty lines:

$for(j in range(0))\
j==$(j) --> \
$if(j<1)\
smaller than 1
$elif(j==1)\
equal to 1
$else\
bigger than 1
$endif\
$endfor\
