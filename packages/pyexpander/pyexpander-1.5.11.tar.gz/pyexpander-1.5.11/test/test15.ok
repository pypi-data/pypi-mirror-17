Now we test the nonlocal statement.
First we set x to 1 and y to 10 and z to 100 
x: 1, y: 10, z: 100
now we begin a block
we declare x and y to be nonlocal

we set x to 2, y to 20 and z to 200

x: 2, y: 20, z: 200
now we start another block:
we declare x to be nonlocal

we set x to 3, y to 30 and z to 300

x: 3, y: 30, z: 300
here the inner block ends
the values of the are variables now:
x: 3, y: 20, z: 200
here the outer block ends
the values of the are variables now:
x: 3, y: 20, z: 100
