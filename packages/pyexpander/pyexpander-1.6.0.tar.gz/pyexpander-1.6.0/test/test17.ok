Here we test some for-loops:

Simple loop from i=1 to 4:
in loop, i=1
in loop, i=2
in loop, i=3
in loop, i=4

end of loop

for_begin loop, this has a scope like
begin..end, loop from i=1 to 4:
set a to 100
in loop, i=1, set a to i, a=1
in loop, i=2, set a to i, a=2
in loop, i=3, set a to i, a=3
in loop, i=4, set a to i, a=4

end of loop
i=4 a=100

Loop over the characters in the string "TEST":
in loop, ch=T
in loop, ch=E
in loop, ch=S
in loop, ch=T
