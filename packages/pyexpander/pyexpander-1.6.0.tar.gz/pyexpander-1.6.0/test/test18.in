Here we test the inclusion of a file:
Set a to 0,$py(a=0) a:$(a)
include the include file here:
$include("test18.include")\
after include file, a now: $(a)

now set a again to 0,$py(a=0) a:$(a)
include the same file with include_begin:
$include_begin("test18.include")\
after include file, a now: $(a)
