Here we test some for-loops:

Simple loop from i=1 to 4:
$for(i in range(1,5))\
in loop, i=$(i)
$endfor
end of loop

for_begin loop, this has a scope like
begin..end, loop from i=1 to 4:
set a to 100$py(a=100)
$for_begin(i in range(1,5))\
in loop, i=$(i), set a to i$py(a=i), a=$(a)
$endfor
end of loop
i=$(i) a=$(a)

Loop over the characters in the string "TEST":
$py(st="TEST")\
$for(ch in st)\
in loop, ch=$(ch)
$endfor\
