Here is a test of evaluation of empty loops and variable scopes.  The following
code shows a simple loop with an if block in it:

i==0 --> smaller than 1
i==1 --> equal to 1
i==2 --> bigger than 1

Now the same code but this time the loop is not executed since we do 
$for(j in range(0)). Since the loop is not executed the variable $(j) is not
defined. pyexpander *must not* evaluate the if conditions since this would lead
to an exception. The following code should just generate empty lines:
