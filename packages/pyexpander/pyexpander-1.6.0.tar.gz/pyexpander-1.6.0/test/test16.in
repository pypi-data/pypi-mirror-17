Here we test a while loop:
loop from i=4, i-- while i>0:
$py(i=4)\
$while(i>0)\
within the loop, i:$(i)
$py(i-=1)\
$endwhile
end of loop

Now we test a loop where the condition is
initially false:
loop from i=-1, i-- while i>0
$py(i=-1)
$while(i>0)\
within the loop, i:$(i)
$py(i-=1)\
$endwhile
end of loop

Here we test a while_begin loop where the while
block is a scope block (like begin-end) at the same time:
i before the loop: $(i)
a is set to 10$py(a=10)
loop from i=2, i-- while i>0
$py(i=2)\
$while_begin(i>0)\
i in loop: $(i)
we set a to i,$py(a=i)
a now: $(a)
$py(i-=1)\
$endwhile\
after while block:
i now: $(i)
a now: $(a)
