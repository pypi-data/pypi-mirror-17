Here we test nested blocks:
$py(x=1)\
at the start, x has a value of $(x)
now the block begins
$begin\
$py(x=2)\
here we set x to 2, value of x: $(x)
now we start another block
$begin\
$py(x=3)\
we set x to 3, value of x: $(x)
now the inner block ends
$end\
value of x here: $(x)
now the outer block ends
$end\
value of x here: $(x)
