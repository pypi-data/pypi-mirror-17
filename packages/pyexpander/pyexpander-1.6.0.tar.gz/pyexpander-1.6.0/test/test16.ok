Here we test a while loop:
loop from i=4, i-- while i>0:
within the loop, i:4
within the loop, i:3
within the loop, i:2
within the loop, i:1

end of loop

Now we test a loop where the condition is
initially false:
loop from i=-1, i-- while i>0


end of loop

Here we test a while_begin loop where the while
block is a scope block (like begin-end) at the same time:
i before the loop: -1
a is set to 10
loop from i=2, i-- while i>0
i in loop: 2
we set a to i,
a now: 2
i in loop: 1
we set a to i,
a now: 1
after while block:
i now: 2
a now: 10
