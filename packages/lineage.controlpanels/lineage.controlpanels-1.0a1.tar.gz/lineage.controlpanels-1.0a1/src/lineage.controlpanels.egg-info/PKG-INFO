        =====================
        lineage.controlpanels
        =====================
        
        .. warning::
            ALPHA: THIS IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL CODE!
        
        Allows Lineage child site specific configurations for plone.registry based controlpanels.
        
        Not available in Lineage Childsites
        -----------------------------------
        
        The following control panels change global settings. Therefore they are not available in subsites.
        
        - content-controlpanel
        - dexterity-types
        - filter-controlpanel
        - maintenance-controlpanel
        - prefs_install_products_form
        - resourceregistry-controlpanel
        - security controlpanel
        - usergroup-groupprefs
        - usergroup-userprefs
        
        
        This is also disabled, but should probably fixed to work with local registries too:
        - portal_registry
        
        This one stores it's configuration in the registry but has changes one setting in portal_actions, which would affect all sites.
        Thus disabled.
        - syndication-controlpanel
        
        
        Installation
