Description: # Datafreezer
        
        Datafreezer is a newsroom tool that enables reporters and editors to easily share datasets.
        
        ## Features
        
        #### Upload
        
        - With each upload, users complete a data dictionary, which describes pertinent fields within a dataset. This ensures that uploaded datasets are well documented.
        	- Users can either upload a dataset that already has header information, or they can add and remove data dictionary fields.
        - Users can include a URL in which the data was sourced and the app will scrape the page for a headline to save.
        - Tag support (with autocomplete)
        
        #### Browse
        
        - Users can browse datasets by
        	- Uploading user
        	- Hub (desk)
        	- Vertical (section)
        	- Tag
        	- Source
        - The app uses a pluggable JSON endpoint to map email addresses to names and certain slugs to names.
        	- This endpoint can be a static JSON or an API.
