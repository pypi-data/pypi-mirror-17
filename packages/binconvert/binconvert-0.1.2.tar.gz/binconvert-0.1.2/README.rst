binconvert
==========

A CLI utility for converting byte orders in binary files from one
platform to another.

Introduction and Motivation
===========================

``binconvert`` is a program that was born out of the author's need to
read old files that were written in a *binary* format on a SPARC system.
Because SPARC's native byte-ordering is *big endian* (ie, most
significant byte first), this caused comptatability issues when porting
these files over to an x86 Linux machine (which has *little endian*, or
least significant byte first native byte-ordering). In an ideal world
where the binary files are *unstructured* and every data value stored in
the file has the same type, one could easily get around this problem by
either recompiling their program with special compiler flags or using
some existing CLI solutions like ``dd conv=swab``.

Unfortunately there are many binary files which are *structured*, ie the
variables stored in the file are of different lengths and types, and so
it becomes necessary to know the internal structure of the file
beforehand. Thankfully, python provides an easy to use
```struct`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html>`__ module
which allows for users to express the structure and byte-ordering of the
data as a format string. For example, "f6s" would imply that the first 4
bytes in the file represent a floating point number, while the remaining
6 bytes designate a 6 character string.

Although this is a much nicer alternative than forcing the user to
manually perform the byte-swapping by hand, it can still break down when
needing to process larger binary files with more complex structures. As
an example, consider a binary file named ``a.bin`` which represents the
following table:

+--------+-----------+--------------+--------------+
| Name   | Age(yr)   | Weight(lb)   | Height(ft)   |
+========+===========+==============+==============+
| Alex   | 26        | 170.5        | 6.0          |
+--------+-----------+--------------+--------------+

Now imagine if this table had hundreds of additional entries. The format
string required by ``struct`` can easily become very long. However, we
know that it can be generalized as a *header* which labels each column
in the table ("4s7s10s10s") followed by the actual entries of the table
("4si2f"), so it should be possible to generate the format string for an
arbitrary number of entries. Using ``binconvert``, without even knowing
the total size of the file beforehand, we can easily convert its
byte-ordering from big to little-endian on an x86 machine using:

.. code:: sh

    bconv a.bin -f 4s7s10s10s 4si2f:*

In summary, ``binconvert``'s main purpose is to extend the functionality
of the python
```struct`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html>`__ module
for these use cases by doing the following:

#. Make it easier to generate format strings for larger files.
#. Provide a simple CLI interface for performing the endianness
   conversion.

Installation and Usage
======================

To install ``binconvert`` from the current codebase, you may use

.. code:: sh

    git clone https://github.com/agoodm/binconvert.git
    cd binconvert
    python setup.py install

If all goes well, you should be able to execute the program with:

.. code:: sh

    bconv -h

In the near future, installation methods using ``pip`` and ``conda``
will be provided.
