============
Django Micro
============

Use Django as microframework. Write small application in single file.


What works
==========

 - Configuration
 - Views and routes
 - Models (with migrations)
 - Custom management commands
 - Custom template tags
 - Admin interface
 - Third party apps

See example_ with usign all of this features.


Example
=======

.. code-block:: python

    from django_micro import configure, route, run
    from django.shortcuts import render

    DEBUG = True
    configure(locals())


    @route(r'^$', name='index')
    def show_index(request):
        name = request.GET.get('name', 'World')
        return render(request, 'index.html', {'name': name})


    application = run()


On localhost application runs with built-in `python app.py runserver` command and deploy as standard WSGI application. No difference, no magick.
