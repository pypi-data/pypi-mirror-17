Description: 
        Diffantom is a whole-brain diffusion MRI (dMRI) phantom publicly available through the 
        Dryad Digital Repository (doi:10.5061/dryad.4p080). The dataset contains two single-shell 
        dMRI images, along with the corresponding gradient information, packed following the BIDS 
        standard (Brain Imaging Data Structure, Gorgolewski et al., 2015). 
        The released dataset is designed for the evaluation of the impact of susceptibility 
        distortions and benchmarking existing correction methods.
        
        
        This project contains the software instruments involved in generating 
        diffantoms, so that researchers are able to generate new phantoms derived 
        from different subjects, and apply these data in other applications like 
        investigating diffusion sampling schemes, the assessment of dMRI processing methods, 
        the simulation of pathologies and imaging artifacts, etc. In summary, Diffantom is 
        intended for unit testing of novel methods, cross-comparison of established methods, 
        and integration testing of partial or complete processing flows to extract connectivity 
        networks from dMRI.
