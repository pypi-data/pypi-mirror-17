Description: ==========
        Django-Zap
        ==========
        
        Compatible with Django 1.8+
        
        For 1.7 compatibility use ``django-zap==0.0.6``
        
        What?
        -----
        
        Automates the destruction and recreation of django databases.
        
        Currently only supports local postgres databases. Feel free to add more
        backends.
        
        Why?
        ----
        
        In the early stages of development when your models are heavily in flux, you
        want to be frequently dropping and recreating the database before re-running
        django's ``syncdb`` command. This tool uses the database settings in your
        settings file to prevent you having to duplicate them in some separate database
        drop/create script.
        
        How?
        ----
        
        Just add ``zap`` to your installed apps.
        
        A new django management command will appear: ``zap_and_create_db``.
        
        Help is at ``python manage.py zap_and_create_db --help`` but the TL;DR is that
        you can run it without arguments and it'll drop the user and database, then
        recreate them. Run it with ``--migrate`` and it'll also run
        ``manage.py migrate``.
        
        Backends
        --------
        
        At the moment the only backend is for linux machines running a local postgresql
        instance, and authentication is done using the ident rule in the ``pg_hba.conf``,
        then calling psql as the ``postgres`` user.
        
        Feel free to provide more backends or extend the one we have, perhaps to include
        mac support, or support for other django database engines.
        
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.0.7 (2016-10-07)
        ------------------
        
        Now only compatible with django 1.8+
        
        - Replaces option_list with add_arguments
        
        
        0.0.6 (2015-10-29)
        ------------------
        
        - Adds ``--droptest`` argument, which also drops the test database. This
          feature is aimed at people using --keepdb to speed up their test runs.
        
        
        0.0.5 (2015-09-16)
        ------------------
        
        - database argument now passed to backend in support of multiple database
          setups.
        
        
        0.0.4 (2015-04-01)
        ------------------
        
        - #3 Adds a new flag ``--dropconnections``, disabled by default, that tells
          postgres to terminate all existing sessions before zapping. This is to work
          around an issue where third party applications open database connections
          upon app registry installation.
