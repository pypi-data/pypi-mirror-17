        A product providing clamav antivirus integration for Plone sites with AT and Dexterity content types.
        It does that by defining a validator which could be used with any content
        type that uses File, Image or Named field(s). The open-source `Clam Antivirus` is
        supported which is available for all platforms.
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        - To start, you need to have ``clamd`` running on some host accessible by your
        instances. ``collective.clamav`` supports either UNIX socket connections or
        remote connections.
        
        - Install collective.clamav and setup the host & port or the path to the
        ``clamd`` socket in the control panel (default is a network connection to
        ``clamd`` listening on *localhost* at port 3310). By default *Files* and
        *Images* are going to be checked for viruses when added or updated.
        
        
        Adding anti-virus protection to non-ATFile based content
        --------------------------------------------------------
        
        If you want to add anti-virus protection to your custom AT content types
        add the *isVirusFree* validator to your FileField(s). For instance:
        
        ::
        
              FileField('file',
                validators = (('isNonEmptyFile', V_REQUIRED),
                              ('isVirusFree', V_REQUIRED),),
                widget = FileWidget(label=u'File'),
              )
        
        ::
        
        If you create custom Dexterity content types add only the necessary import statement to the
        module and all plone.namedfile fields were automatically scaned:
        
        ::
        
        from Products.validation import V_REQUIRED)
        
        ::
