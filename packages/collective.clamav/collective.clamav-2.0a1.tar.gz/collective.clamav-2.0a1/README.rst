A product providing clamav antivirus integration for Plone sites with AT and Dexterity content types.
It does that by defining a validator which could be used with any content
type that uses File, Image or Named field(s). The open-source `Clam Antivirus` is
supported which is available for all platforms.



Usage
-----

- To start, you need to have ``clamd`` running on some host accessible by your
instances. ``collective.clamav`` supports either UNIX socket connections or
remote connections.

- Install collective.clamav and setup the host & port or the path to the
``clamd`` socket in the control panel (default is a network connection to
``clamd`` listening on *localhost* at port 3310). By default *Files* and
*Images* are going to be checked for viruses when added or updated.


Adding anti-virus protection to non-ATFile based content
--------------------------------------------------------

If you want to add anti-virus protection to your custom AT content types
add the *isVirusFree* validator to your FileField(s). For instance:

::

      FileField('file',
        validators = (('isNonEmptyFile', V_REQUIRED),
                      ('isVirusFree', V_REQUIRED),),
        widget = FileWidget(label=u'File'),
      )

::

If you create custom Dexterity content types add only the necessary import statement to the
module and all plone.namedfile fields were automatically scaned:

::

from Products.validation import V_REQUIRED)

::
