SYNOPSIS
========
    ct-* [compilation args] [filename.cpp] [--variant=<VARIANT>]

DESCRIPTION
===========
The various ct-* tools exist to build C/C++ executables with almost no 
configuration. For example, to build a C or C++ program, type

    ct-cake --auto

which will try to determine the correct source files to generate executables
from and also determine the tests to build and run.

A variant is a configuration file that specifies various configurable settings
like the compiler and compiler flags. Common variants are "debug" and "release".

Other notable tools are 

* ct-headertree: provides information about structure of the include files
* ct-filelist:   provides the list of files needed to be included in a tarball (e.g. for packaging)
