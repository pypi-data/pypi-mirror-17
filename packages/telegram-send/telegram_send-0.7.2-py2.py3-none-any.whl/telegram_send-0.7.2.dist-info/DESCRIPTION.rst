Telegram-send is a command-line tool to send messages and files over
Telegram to your account or to a channel. It provides a simple interface
that can be easily called from other programs.

Usage
=====

To send a message:

.. code:: shell

    telegram-send "hello, world"

To send a file:

.. code:: shell

    telegram-send --file document.pdf

To send an image with an optional caption:

.. code:: shell

    telegram-send --image photo.jpg --caption "The Moon at night"

Telegram-send integrates into your file manager (Thunar, Nautilus and
Nemo):

Install
=======

Install telegram-send system-wide with pip:

.. code:: shell

    sudo pip3 install telegram-send

Or if you want to install it for a single user:

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install telegram-send

If installed for a single user you need to add ``~/.local/bin`` to their
path:

.. code:: shell

    echo 'PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile

(This will be in effect on the next login, do a ``. ~/.profile`` for the
impatient.)

And finally configure it with ``telegram-send --configure`` if you want
to send to your account, or with ``telegram-send --configure-channel``
to send to a channel.

Use the ``--config`` option to use multiple configurations. For example
to set up sending to a channel in a non-default configuration:
``telegram-send --config channel.conf --configure-channel``. Then always
specify the config file to use it:
``telegram-send --config channel.conf "hello"``.

Examples
========

Here are some examples to get a taste of what is possible with
telegram-send.

alert on completion of shell commands
-------------------------------------

Receive an alert when long-running commands finish with the ``tg``
alias, based on Ubuntu's built-in ``alert``. Put the following in your
``~/.bashrc``:

.. code:: shell

    alias tg='telegram-send "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo "" || echo "error: ") $(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*tg$//'\'')"'

And then use it like ``sleep 10: tg``.

To automatically receive notifications for long running commands, use
`ntfy <https://github.com/dschep/ntfy>`__ with the Telegram backend.

periodic messages with cron
---------------------------

We can combine telegram-send with
`cron <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron>`__ to periodically send
messages. Here we will set up a cron job to send the `Astronomy Picture
of the Day <http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html>`__ to the
`astropod <https://telegram.me/astropod>`__ channel.

Create a bot by talking to the
`BotFather <https://telegram.me/botfather>`__, create a public channel
and add your bot as administrator to the channel. You will need to
explicitly search for your bot's username when adding it. Then run
``telegram-send --configure-channel --config astropod.conf``. We will
use the
`apod.py <https://github.com/rahiel/telegram-send/blob/master/examples/apod.py>`__
script that gets the daily picture and calls telegram-send to post it to
the channel.

We create a cron job ``/etc/cron.d/astropod`` with the content:

.. code:: shell

    SHELL=/bin/sh
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

    # m h dom mon dow user  command
    0 1 * * * telegram ~/apod.py --config ~/astropod.conf

Make sure the file ends with a newline. Cron will then execute the
script every day at 1:00 as the user ``telegram``. Join the
`astropod <https://telegram.me/astropod>`__ channel to see the result.

supervisor process state notifications
--------------------------------------

`Supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`__ controls and monitors processes.
It can start processes at boot, restart them if they fail and also
report on their status.
`Supervisor-alert <https://github.com/rahiel/supervisor-alert>`__ is a
simple plugin for supervisor that sends messages on process state
updates to an arbitrary program. Using it with telegram-send (by using
the ``--telegram`` option), you can receive notifications whenever one
of your processes exits.

Uninstall
=========

.. code:: shell

    sudo telegram-send --clean
    sudo pip3 uninstall telegram-send

Or if you installed it for a single user:

.. code:: shell

    telegram-send --clean
    pip3 uninstall telegram-send
