Description: ``pystory``
        ===========
        
        Keep a local history of everything you do inside your virtual python environment.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        After activating your virtual environment, install the module with::
        
            pip install pystory
        
        Add the following line to your ``.bashrc``/``.bash_profile`` file to enable ``pystory``::
        
            export PROMPT_COMMAND='if [ ! -z ${VIRTUAL_ENV+x} ]; then echo "$(date "+%Y-%m-%d.%H:%M:%S") $(pwd) $(history 1)" >> $VIRTUAL_ENV/.pystory; fi'
        
        
        The contents of `PROMPT_COMMAND <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO/x264.html>`_ are executed as a regular Bash command just before Bash displays a prompt.
        
        This line adds your last command as an entry to the ``.pystory`` file, which will be placed in your ``$VIRTUAL_ENV/`` folder. 
        
        Ex::
        
            /Users/username/project/.venv/.pystory
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Check your pystory by typing ``pystory`` while your virtual environment is activated.
        
        ::
        
            $ pystory
            Hist    Count    Command
            1       1.       pip install requests
            2       1.       pip install Django
            5       3.       python
            ...
        
        Note that the output is compressed, so only the last history entry of a command is listed, with the count of times the command is used.
        
        ::
        
            $ pystory find Django
