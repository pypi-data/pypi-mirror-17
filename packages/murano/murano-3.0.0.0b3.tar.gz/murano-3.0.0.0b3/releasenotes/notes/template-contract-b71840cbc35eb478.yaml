features:
  - New contract function ``template`` was introduced. ``template`` works
    similar to the ``class`` in regards to the data validation but does not
    instantiate objects. Instead the data is left in the object model
    in dictionary format so that it could be instantiated later with the new()
    function. In addition it allows to exclude specified properties from
    validation and resulting template so that they could be provided later.
    Objects that are assigned to the property or argument with ``template``
    contract will be automatically converted to their object model
    representation.
