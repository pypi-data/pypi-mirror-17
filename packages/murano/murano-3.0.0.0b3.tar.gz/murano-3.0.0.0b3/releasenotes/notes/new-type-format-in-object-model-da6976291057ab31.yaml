critical:
  - Type representation in object model was changed. Previous format was
    to have three attributes in "?" section of the object - type, classVersion
    and package where only the "type" is mandatory. Now they are merged into
    single attribute "type" that has a format typeName/version@package.
    Version and package parts are still optional.
