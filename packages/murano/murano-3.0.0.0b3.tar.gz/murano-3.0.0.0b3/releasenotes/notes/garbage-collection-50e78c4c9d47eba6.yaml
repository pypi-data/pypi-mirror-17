features:
  - Introduce new MuranoPL class ``io.murano.system.GC``.
    For now MuranoPL garbage collector can be used for
    setup destruction dependencies between murano objects.
    If object Foo is subscribed to object Bar destruction
    it will be notified with the specific handler. If both
    Foo and Bar should be destroyed during one execution session
    Foo will be destroyed after Bar. If you don't want to notify
    subscriber about target destruction you may not specify handler.
    Handler can be static or usual action.
