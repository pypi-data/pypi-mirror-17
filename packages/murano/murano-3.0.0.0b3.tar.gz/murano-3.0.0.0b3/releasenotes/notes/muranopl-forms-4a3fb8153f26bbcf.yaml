features:
  - New engine RPC call to generate json-schema from MuranoPL class.
    Schema may be generated either from entire class or for specific
    model builders - static actions that can be used to generate
    object model from their input. Class schema is built by inspecting
    class properties and method schema using the same algorithm but applied
    to its arguments.
