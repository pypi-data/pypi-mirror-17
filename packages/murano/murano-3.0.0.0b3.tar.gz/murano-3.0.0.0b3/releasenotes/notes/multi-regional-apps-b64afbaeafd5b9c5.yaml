  - Support for application deployment across OpenStack regions was added.
    Now all OpenStack resource classes inherit CloudResource that provides
    getRegion method and regionName property. This allows to assign resources
    to different regions. getRegion() returns CloudRegion instance that
    resource or it parent belong to. CloudRegion has the similar interface
    to Environment class and is the correct way to get HeatStack instance
    associated with the regoin, default network configuration, security
    group manager and agent listener instances. Environment acts as the
    default region so backward compatibility is not broken. However new
    applications should not use environment to set security group rules but
    rather a region(s) of their instance(s) in order to work correctly when
    their instances were configured to use region other then the default.
