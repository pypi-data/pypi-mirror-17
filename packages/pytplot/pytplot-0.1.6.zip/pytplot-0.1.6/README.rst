Pytplot is a python plotting library which aims to mimic the functionality of 
the IDL "tplot" libraries.  It can be used in python scripts, or interactively 
through IPython and the Jupyter notebook.  

Install Python
=============

You will need Python version 3.5 to run pytplot.  

It is recommended that you install `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads/>`_, as it comes with a suite of packages that are useful for data science. 

You could also install python directly from `python.org <https://www.python.org/download/>`_.

Install pytplot
=============

Open up a terminal, and type::

	pip install pytplot
	
This will install pytplot and all of it's dependencies.  

Running Pytplot
=============

To start using pytplot in a similar manner to IDL tplot, start up an interactive environment through the terminal command::

	ipython 
	
or, if you prefer the jupyter interactive notebook::

	jupyter notebook
	
then, just import the package by typing the command::

	import pytplot

A full list of functions will eventually be found in `pytplot/docs/routine_doc.html <http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/MAVENSDC/PyTplot/blob/master/docs/routine_doc.html>`_.  It is still being updated.
