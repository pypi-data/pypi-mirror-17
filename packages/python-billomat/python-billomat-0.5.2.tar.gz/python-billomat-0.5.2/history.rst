- Invoice-Items: Now it is possible to fetch the invoice items for more then
  one invoice with one request.

  The parameter *invoice_id* for the search can now contain a list of invoice ids.
  If list with IDs given: The result contains the invoice-items of
  many invoices. Be careful: Too many invoice IDs can produce to
  large responses or to large SQL statements.
  My recommendation: 10-50 invoice IDs at one time.

- Recurring-Items: Now it is possible to fetch the recurring items for more then
  one recurring with one request.

  The parameter *recurring_id* for the search can now contain a list of recurring ids.
  If list with IDs given: The result contains the recurring-items of
  many recurrings. Be careful: To many recurring IDs can produce to
  large responses or to large SQL statements.
  My recommendation: 10-50 recurring IDs at one time.
