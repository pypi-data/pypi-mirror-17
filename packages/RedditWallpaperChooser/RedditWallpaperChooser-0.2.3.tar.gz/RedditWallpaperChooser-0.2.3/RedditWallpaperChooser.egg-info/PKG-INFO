Description: # RedditWallpaperChooser
        
        RedditWallpaperChooser will download the trending wallpapers of the day from any subreddit of your choice.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Choose the subreddits you like.
        * Filter by aspect ratio and image size.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        We make use of Python's 3 asynchronous APIs and `async`/`await` syntax.
        For this reason, we only support Python versions â‰¥ 3.5.
        
        Additional requirements are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
        
        ## Installation & Usage
        
        Until RedditWallpaperChooser will land on PyPi you can install it as follows:
        
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/aldur/RedditWallpaperChooser/
        $ cd RedditWallpaperChooser
        $ pip install . .[extras]  # --user could also help you
        ```
        
        You'll find `reddit-wallpaper-chooser` in your `PATH`. You can now start collecting wallpapers.
        
        ```bash
        $ reddit-wallpaper-chooser
        ```
        
        The absolute path of one of the downloaded wallpapers will be printed out to standard output.
        
        ### macOS
        
        As a bonus, on macOS, you can set the wallpaper to the one just downloaded for you:
        ```bash
        $ wall=$(reddit-wallpaper-chooser 2> /dev/null) && osascript -e "tell application \"Finder\" to set desktop picture to POSIX file \"$wall\""
        ```
        
        _Note_: due to a limitation of the macOS APIs, it will only change the wallpaper of the currently selected space.
        
        ## Configuration
        
        You can configure RedditWallpaperChooser by providing a `ini` configuration file.
        In it, you can specify the following general options:
        
        - the subreddits to parse (`subreddits`)
        - the number of results per subreddit (`result_limit`)
        - the output directory (`output_folder`)
        - the subreddit sorting (`sorting`)
        - a time parameter for 'top'/'controversial' sorting (`time`)
        
        Additionally, you can also filter the candidate wallpapers to be selected and returned at the end of the download process:
        
        - by aspect ratio (`aspect_ratio`)
        - by minimum size (`size`)
        
        Until better documentation will be developed please refer to the default configuration options as a working example;
        You can dump it as follows:
        
        ```bash
        $ reddit-wallpaper-chooser -d config.ini
        ```
        
        You can then use your configuration with:
        
        ```bash
        $ reddit-wallpaper-chooser -c config.ini
        ```
        
        ## Future improvements
        
        - Filter wallpapers by color.
        - Avoid choosing again the same images.
        - Add a proper test suite.
