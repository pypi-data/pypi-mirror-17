Version 0.6.7
-------------
- fix compatibility with Python 3 for conecyl
- tests for conecyl
- non-linear static analysis for Panel
- replaced bladestiff2d model with already existing panel models
- panel.connections.penalty_constants based on COST paper
- pass panel object instead of w1tx, w2tx to connections, field and stiffness
  matrices
- replaced tstiff2d base-flange connectivity matrices by those in
  panel.connections
- remove support to integrate from x1 to x2 in TStiff2D
- TStiff2D no longer recommended due to highly numerical instability
- think about with panel.offset,
  why it is not being used to calculated laminaprop? This should be an option,
  for example when calculating stiffener base laminate, which shares the same
  domain of the skin. Offset is currently only used for the inertia properties
  when calculating kM, but not for the stiffness B matrix
- general code simplification possible due to measures above

Version 0.7.0
-------------
- allow a constant stress state using static results for linear buckling
- mass matrices also valid for variable property along domain (perhaps with
  numerical integration)
- create a boundary class with w1tx etc?
- pass the laminate class instead of plyt etc, make read_stack decided whether
  to use plyt/plyts, laminaprop/laminaprops and so forth
- enhance analysis.freq to support damping
  -- then remove lb, freq and static from Panel
- using the Bardell's strategy, perhaps move code from Mathematica to
  SymPy
- check why plate lb with reduced_dof=True is not the same as plate_w
- reconsider reading bardell_12 from the C code and reuse in FORTRAN

Version 0.8.0
-------------
- implement CI compilation and test for FORTRANs
- improve the numerical stability of FORTRAN's eigensolver (cpanelbay)
- skew panel with formulation for stringers not aligned with the panel
  longitudinal direction
- put matrices for cones and cylinders in the new format and unify their
  calculation as we did for compmech.panel
- robustness of sparse-solver for the panel module, it is really a pain to use
  the dense solver because of the relative slowness...
- tune eigenvalue solver for freq in compmech.panel, similarly to what has
  been done for linear buckling analysis....
- add Third-Order Shear Deformation Theory to deal with many papers using
  shear correction factors
- finish implementing compmech.plate for Monteiro

Version 1.0.0 (long term)
--------------------------
- finite element solver
