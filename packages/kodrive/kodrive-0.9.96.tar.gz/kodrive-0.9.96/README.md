Synchronize remote files and directories across different devices with an easy-to-use CLI.

## Getting Started

### Install KoDrive
To set ```kodrive``` (the KoDrive CLI) as a local command:

    $ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jvlythical/KoDrive/master/static/get-kodrive.py | python

If a dependency is missing, please refer [below] (#dependencies) for installation guidance.  

### Initialize the KoDrive Daemon

```sh
$ kodrive sys start
```

## Receiving Directories

1. Provide the other person with your **system key**:

  ```sh
  $ kodrive sys key 
  ```
2. The person sharing with you will then provide a **directory key**:

  ```sh
  $ kodrive link <DIRECTORY-KEY>
  ```

## Sharing Directories

1. A folder needs to be **authorized** with another user's system key:   

  ```sh
  $ kodrive auth <SYSTEM-KEY> 
  ```
2. Then obtain and provide the below **directory key** back to the other user:
 
  ```sh
  $ kodrive dir key <PATH>
  ```

## Receiving/Sharing Directories in Detail
_**CAUTION**: If you decide to skip this section, please continue on to the Conflicts section._

_**Note**: 'Sharer' refers to the person that is sharing their directory and 'receiver' refers to the person that the 'sharer' is sharing their directory with._

First, the receiver(s) need to supply their system key(s) to the sharer with:
```sh
$ kodrive sys key
```

The sharer then:

1. Adds the directory to be shared with ```kodrive add <PATH>```
  ```sh
  $ kodrive dir add <PATH>
  $ kodrive ls
  ```

  * _**Note**: ```kodrive ls``` is optional and can be used before and/or after adding and freeing directories to verify._
2. Authorizes a receiver to that directory (```-a``` stands for ```--add```).
  ```sh
  $ kodrive dir auth -a <RECEIVER-SYSTEM-KEY> <PATH>
  $ kodrive dir auth -l
  ```

  * _**Note**: ```kodrive dir auth -l``` is optional and can be used before and after de/authorizing devices to see who has access to which directories._
3. Gets the key which the receiver will need to link.

  ```sh
  $ kodrive dir key <PATH>
  ```

Running ```kodrive key <PATH>``` will return the directory's key, which needs to be passed to the receiver(s).

_**Note**: When there are multiple receivers, the sharer will need to authorize each receiver and supply them with the key._


The receiver(s) then link to the sharer **in the directory** where they would like to save the files:

_**CAUTION**: linking will merge the 2 directories so that the sharer and receiver will have access to **everything in BOTH** directories. This can lead to the sharing of sensitive data as well as conflicts if there are files with the same name. It is recommended for a receiver to link while in an empty directory. See [conflicts](https://github.com/Jvlythical/KoDrive#conflicts) for more information._

```sh
$ kodrive link <DIRECTORY-KEY>
```

Now the authorized devices have access to the directory and can add, modify and remove files. KoDrive is configured so that the daemon scans the directory for changes every 30 seconds.

To force a rescan and sync the directory immediately:
```sh
$ kodrive dir push <PATH>
```

## Stopping Synchronization
The sharer can deauthorize access to certain users:

1. ```kodrive dir auth -l``` lists all directories authorized to others and the devices which are authorized. This can be useful for ```kodrive dir auth -a/-r``` to obtain system keys and verify whether a device has been deauthorized.

2. ```kodrive dir auth -r <RECEIVER-SYSTEM-KEY> <PATH>``` deauthorizes a certain receiver to a directory. (```-r``` for ```--remove```) 

```sh
$ kodrive dir auth -l
$ kodrive dir auth -r <RECEIVER-SYSTEM-KEY> <PATH>
```

Furthermore, the sharer can completely remove the directory from the daemon which will deauthorize all devices from that directory:
```sh
$ kodrive dir free <PATH>
```

The receiver(s) can only ```kodrive dir free <PATH>``` since it is not their directory. They are not allowed to ```kodrive dir auth -a/-r``` since they are not the sharer:
```sh
$ kodrive dir free <PATH>
```


## Advanced Usage

### Server Mode

By default, all daemons are in client mode.
For normal use cases, use **_Client-Client_** synchronization described above. Server mode can be advantageous for quick sharing and syncing from a single device such as a secure server, but can be dangerous if misused. Note that **_Server-Client_** connections will not work if the device in Server mode does not allow direct or open connections.

_**CAUTION**: **Server-Client** connections can be unsecure and can lead to potential security risks if used improperly._

To switch into server mode:
```sh
$ kodrive sys start -s
```

To switch back into client mode:
```sh
$ kodrive sys start -c
```

To see the KoDrive status and which mode it is currently in:
```sh
$ kodrive sys info
```

#### Synchronizing as Server-Client

The server (in Server mode) does:
```sh
$ kodrive dir add <PATH>
$ kodrive dir key <PATH>
```

The client(s) (in Client mode) run:
```sh
$ kodrive link <KEY>
```
with the key given by the server.

</p>

#### Stopping Synchronization as Server-Client
For both the sharer and the receivers:
```sh
$ kodrive dir free <PATH>
```

### Statistics
To see statistics on a directory currently being synchronized:
```sh
$ kodrive dir info <PATH>
```

### Changing the Rescan Interval
By default, KoDrive scans each directory every 30 seconds for changes and propagates those changes to all linked directories. Decreasing the interval can lead to faster syncing, but will make KoDrive more CPU and memory intensive and vice versa. This can be problematic if syncing large directories/files on slower computers and it is advised to seek a balance.

Note: this will only change the interval on the device running this command and will restart KoDrive.

### Conflicts

_**CAUTION**: KoDrive will not automatically start when your computer boots up, please start KoDrive to avoid potential conflicts._

If a file is modified on different devices simultaneously or files with the same name in different directories are synchronized, the file on the device with the larger value of the first 63 bits for their device ID will be marked as the conflicting file. The file will be renamed to ```<filename>.sync- conflict-<date>-<time>.<ext>```

It will be up to the users to resolve conflicts and update files. It is advised to avoid conflicts if possible.

Please note that if users modify conflict files, it is possible to end up with conflicting conflict files.
Those will be named as ```sync-conflict-...sync-conflict -...-sync-conflict``` files.
