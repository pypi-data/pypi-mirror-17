``LSD``
========================

This directory contains the source code for the `LSD`_ program, which performs fast dating of phylogenies using least-squares criteria and algorithms.

The code was added using ``git-subtree`` with the following commands::

    git remote add lsd https://github.com/fastdating/lsd
    git subtree add --prefix=phydmslib/LSD/lsd lsd master --squash
