``django-rest-framework-filters`` is an extension to Django REST framework that makes working with filtering much easier.  In addition to fixing some underlying warts and limitations of ``django-filter``, we allow arbitrary chaining of both relations and lookup filters.

E.g. using ``django-rest-framework-filters`` instead of just ``django-filter``, we can do stuff like::

    /api/page/?author__username__icontains=john
    /api/page/?author__username__endswith=smith

Without having to create a zillion filter fields by hand.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install djangorestframework-filters

Requirements
------------

* Python 2.7+
* Django 1.8+
* Django REST framework 3.0+

Usage
-----

Here's how you were probably doing filtering before:

.. code-block:: python

    import django_filters
    from myapp.models import Product

    class ProductFilter(django_filters.FilterSet):
        manufacturer = django_filters.CharFilter(name="manufacturer__name")

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['category', 'in_stock', 'manufacturer']


To use ``django-rest-framework-filters``, simply import ``rest_framework_filters`` instead of
``django_filters``:

.. code-block:: python

    import rest_framework_filters as filters
    from myapp.models import Product

    class ProductFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        manufacturer = filters.CharFilter(name="manufacturer__name")

        class Meta:
            model = Product
            fields = ['category', 'in_stock', 'manufacturer']

All filters found in ``django-filter`` are available for usage.  In this case, there's nothing new
that's gained.  But read onward!


Chaining filtering through relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable chained filtering through relations:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class UserFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        username = filters.CharFilter(name='username')
        ...

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.CharFilter(name='title')
        author = filters.RelatedFilter(UserFilter, name='author')
        ...

    # Then just use the PageFilter as you would any other FilterSet:

    class PageView(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
        ...
        filter_class = PageFilter

then we can automatically chain our filters through the ``author`` relation, as so::

    /api/page/?author__username=philipn

Recursive relations are also supported.  You will need to specify the full module
path in the ``RelatedFilter`` definition in some cases, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class PersonFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        name = filters.AllLookupsFilter(name='name')
        best_friend = filters.RelatedFilter('people.views.PersonFilter', name='best_friend')

        class Meta:
            model = Person


Allowing any lookup type on a field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use the ``AllLookupsFilter`` to allow all possible lookup types on a particular
field.  While we could otherwise specify these by hand, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class ProductFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        min_price = filters.NumberFilter(name="price", lookup_type='gte')
        ...

to allow the ``price__gte`` lookup.  But this gets cumbersome, and we sometimes want to
allow any possible lookups on particular fields.  We do this by using ``AllLookupsFilter``:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.AllLookupsFilter(name='title')
        ...

then we can use any possible lookup on the ``title`` field, e.g.::

    /api/page/?title__icontains=park

or ::

    /api/page/?title__startswith=The

and also filter on the default lookup (``exact``), as usual::

    /api/page/?title=The%20Park

Additionally, you may use ``ALL_LOOKUPS`` with dictionary style declarations.

.. code-block:: python

    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        ...

        class Meta:
            fields = {
                'title': filters.ALL_LOOKUPS,
            }


Combining RelatedFilter and AllLookupsFilter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can combine ``RelatedFilter`` and ``AllLookupsFilter``:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework import viewsets
    import rest_framework_filters as filters

    class PageFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        title = filters.CharFilter(name='title')
        author = filters.RelatedFilter(UserFilter, name='author')

    class UserFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        username = AllLookupsFilter(name='username')
        ...

then we can filter like so::

    /api/page/?author__username__icontains=john

Automatic Filter Negation/Exclusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FilterSets also support automatic exclusion using a simple ``k!=v`` syntax. This syntax
internally sets the ``exclude`` property on the filter.

    /api/page/?title!=The%20Park

This syntax supports regular filtering combined with exclusion filtering. For example,
the following would search for all articles containing "Hello" in the title, while
excluding those containing "World".

    /api/articles/?title__contains=Hello&title__contains!=World

MethodFilter Reimplementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``MethodFilter`` has been reimplemented to work across relationships. This is not a
forwards-compatible change and requires adding a minimal amount of boilerplate to the
filter method.

When filtering across relationships, the queryset and lookup value will be different.
For example:

.. code-block:: python

    class PostFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        author = filters.RelatedFilter('AuthorFilter')
        is_published = filters.MethodFilter()

        class Meta:
            model = Post
            fields = ['title', 'content']

        def filter_is_published(self, name, qs, value):
            # convert value to boolean
            null = value.lower() != 'true'

            # The lookup name will end with `is_published`, but could be
            # preceded by a related lookup path.
            if LOOKUP_SEP in name:
                rel, _ = name.rsplit(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)
                name = LOOKUP_SEP.join([rel, 'date_published__isnull'])
            else:
                name = 'date_published__isnull'

            return qs.filter(**{name: null})

    class AuthorFilter(filters.FilterSet):
        posts = filters.RelatedFilter('PostFilter')

        class Meta:
            model = Author
            fields = ['name']

And given these API calls:

.. code-block:: http

    /api/posts/?is_published=true

    /api/authors/?posts__is_published=true


In the first API call, the filter method receives a queryset of posts. In the second,
it receives a queryset of users. The filter method in the example modifies the lookup
name to work across the relationship, allowing you to find published posts, or authors
who have published posts.


DjangoFilterBackend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We implement our own subclass of ``DjangoFilterBackend``, which you should probably use instead
of the default ``DjangoFilterBackend``.  Our ``DjangoFilterBackend`` caches repeated filter set
generation â€” a particularly important optimization when using ``RelatedFilter`` and ``AllLookupsFilter``.

To use our ``FilterBackend``, in your `settings.py``, simply use:

.. code-block:: python

    REST_FRAMEWORK = {
        ...
        'DEFAULT_FILTER_BACKENDS': (
            'rest_framework_filters.backends.DjangoFilterBackend', ...
        ),

instead of the default ``rest_framework.filters.DjangoFilterBackend``.

What warts are fixed?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if you're not using ``RelatedFilter`` or ``AllLookupsFilter``, you will probably want
to use ``django-rest-framework-filters``.  For instance, if you simply use ``django-filter``
it is very difficult to filter on a ``DateTimeFilter`` in the date format emitted by
the default serializer (ISO 8601), which makes working with your API difficult.

Can I mix and match `django-filter` and `django-rest-framework-filters`?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes you can.  `django-rest-framework-filters` extends `django-filter`, and you can mix and match them as you please.  For a given class, you should use only one of ``django-filter`` or
``django-rest-framework-filters``, but you can use ``RelatedFilter`` to
link to a filter relation defined elsewhere that uses vanilla ``django-filter``.

Caveats
~~~~~~~

djangorestframework-filters is not compatible with the filterset's `order_by`
meta option. Use `rest_framework.filters.OrderingFilter` instead if you need
to support ordering.
