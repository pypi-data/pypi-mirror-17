In this suite we test the following workflow:
* A record harvested from source "A" is inserted into the database.
* The database record is annotaded via external sources (e.g. Catalogers).
* We receive an update from source "B" and we only want to add extra fields
  while not losing any of the data added by "A" as source of truth.

The expected behavior is:
* Record order in list fields is given the source of truth record.
  Update won't perform any:
  * Additions
  * Reorderings
  * _Deletions_
* Any field present in "A" will be locked to the value added in "A".
* Any field addition added in "B" will be present in the end result.
* Any field change that is not present in "A" will be updated by the "B" update.
