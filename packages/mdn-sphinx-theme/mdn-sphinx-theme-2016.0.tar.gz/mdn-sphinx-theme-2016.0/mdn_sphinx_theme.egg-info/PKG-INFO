Description: Mozilla Developer Network Sphinx Theme
        ======================================
        
        This is a version of the Mozilla Developer Network theme, for
        the `Sphinx documentation engine`_. It is used for the
        `Kuma development documentation`_.
        
        Here is how I use it
        --------------------
        
        To use it, you need to clone it somewhere in your Sphinx's architecture::
        
            $ pip install mdn-sphinx-theme
        
        and to configure Sphinx to use it. In your `conf.py` file::
        
            import mdn_theme
        
            html_theme_path = [mdn_theme.get_theme_dir()]
            html_theme = 'mdn'
        
        Take care and remove the `pygments_style` configuration, as it may not be of
        the better taste with the mozilla's theme.
        
        Any contributions are of course welcome!
        
        Readthedocs
        -----------
        
        Add a pip requirements file to your project and have the following
        packages listed there::
        
            Sphinx
            mdn-sphinx-theme
        
        Then configure your Readthedocs project to use that requirement file
        before rendering your project's documentation.
