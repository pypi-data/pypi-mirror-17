Installing Adventurelib
=======================


With pip
--------

Adventurelib is pip-installable. If you have a working pip, you should be able
to simply type (at a command prompt)::

    pip install adventurelib


Single file
-----------

adventurelib is a single file. If you download the package from PyPI or browse
the project on GitHub, ``adventurelib.py`` is all you need. You can save this
file alongside your game script and use it directly.
