    "**August 28, 2016** - version 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Added support for nested environments of the same type**. Nesting environments of different type was already possible, but there was a limitation for nesting environments of the same kind; eg itemize in itemize in itemize. This was due to to the fact that regular expressions are not suited to recursivity. I have developped a series of functions that enable to extract nested environments and thus cope with such situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Corrected various issues, eg [#731](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/731), [#720](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/720) where the content of nested environments was incorrectly converted to markdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Completely reworked the configuration toolbar. Re-added tips.\n",
    "- Added a toggle-button for the LaTeX\\_envs menu\n",

    "- Reworked extension loading. It now detects if the notebook is fully loaded before loading itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**August 03, 2016** - version 1.13\n",

    "```\n",
    "jupyter nbconvert --to html_toclenvs FILE.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Added a dropdown menu that enables to insert all main LaTeX\\_envs environments using a simple click. Two keybards shortcuts (Ctrl-E and Ctrl-I) for equations and itemize are also provided. More environments and shortcuts can be added in the file `envsLatex.js`.\n",

    "- In this version I have reworked **equation numbering**. In the previous version, I used a specialized counter and detected equations rendering for updating this counter. Meanwhile, this feature has been introduced in `MathJax` and now we rely on MathJax implementation. rendering is significantly faster. We still have keep the capability of displaying only equation labels (instead of numbers). The numbering is automatically updated and is document-wide.\n",

    "The main idea is to override the standard Markdown renderer in order to add a *small* parsing of LaTeX expressions and environments. This heavily uses regular expressions. The LaTeX expression are then rendered using an html version. For instance `\\underline {something}` is rendered as `<u> something </u>`, that is \\underline{something}. The environments are replaced by an html tag with a class derived from the name of the environment. For example, a `definition` denvronment will be replaced by an html rendering corresponding to the class `latex_definition`. The styles associated with the different classes are specified in `latex_env.css`. These substitutions are implemented in `thsInNb4.js`."
