Python wrapper for the RingPlus API


Documentation
-------------

`Python RingPlus`_ Read the Docs

Installation
------------

Using pip and pypi::

    pip install ringplus

You can also install via::

    pip install git+https://github.com/Shatnerz/ringplus.git

If you plan on making changes. I would install on editable mode in pip via::

    git clone https://github.com/Shatnerz/ringplus.git

    cd ringplus

    pip install -e .


Notes
-----

I'm not sure how to check the registration requests, change device requests,
and change phone number requests. There may be issues with that code.


Todo
----

I plan on adding tests, documentation, and providing better examples.

For now, check the examples directory to get a better understanding.


Contribute
----------

I'll likely accept all pull request. Feel free to provide suggestions.
