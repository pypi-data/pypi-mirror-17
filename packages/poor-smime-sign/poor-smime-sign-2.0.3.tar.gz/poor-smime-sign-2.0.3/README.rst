A very poor tool to generate S/MIME signatures for arbitrary content & probably insecurely too.

A quick example:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> smime_sign(
    ...     signer_cert_path="/path/to/files/signer.cert",
    ...     signer_key_path="/path/to/files/signer.pem",
    ...     recipient_cert_path="/path/to/files/recipient.cert",
    ...     content="test",
    ...     output_format="PEM",
    ... )

Features
--------

* Does S/MIME signatures.
* Verifies S/MIME signatures.


Why?
--------

This utility library has single purpose - provide support for making
S/MIME signatures on Python2 **and 3**, which currently lacks any
proper libraries for that purpose.

The main use case it is built for: at work our system has to generate
Apple Passbook Pass files, which include an S/MIME
signature. Currently it is done using ``M2Crypto.SMIME``. While that
works - we want to migrate to Python3, and unfortunately for us
``M2Crypto`` is not fully supported. ``smime_sign`` is a poor man's
solution for this problem.

Internally this does nothing more than call `openssl smime`_, so you
might want to see its docs too.

.. _openssl smime: https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/apps/smime.html


Why not?
--------

* This may be insecure.
* This may be slow if you are signing large blobs of text.


API
===

``smime_sign(signer_cert_path, signer_key_path, cert_path, recipient_cert_path, content, output_format)``
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generates and returns signature string for ``content`` in
``output_format``.

All ``*_path`` arguments must be absolute
paths.

``content`` must be a string, not a path.

Example to generate signature for Passbook manifest:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> manifest_json = "..."  # JSON string with `manifest.json` content
    >>> signature = smime_sign(
    ...     signer_cert_path="/path/to/files/signer.cert",
    ...     signer_key_path="/path/to/files/signer.pem",
    ...     cert_path="/path/to/files/intermediate.cert",
    ...     recipient_cert_path=None,
    ...     content=manifest_json,
    ...     output_format="DER",
    ... )

``smime_verify(signer_cert_path, content_path, signature_path, signature_format)``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verifies a ``content_path`` file against a signature at ``signature_path``.

Note: this function was added to help in the tests only.
