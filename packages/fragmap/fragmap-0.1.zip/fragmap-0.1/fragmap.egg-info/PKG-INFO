Description: # git fragmap - better commit visualization for git
        
        
        # Requirements
        
        npyscreen, which requires curses. For Windows curses can be obtained precompiled from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#curses
        Install using pip, example:
        
            pip install curses-2.2-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl
        
        Npyscreen itself has to be built from the included npyscreen/ directory, as we
        require some non-standard functionality that has been patched into this directory.
        Simply do:
        
            cd npyscreen/
            python setup.py install
