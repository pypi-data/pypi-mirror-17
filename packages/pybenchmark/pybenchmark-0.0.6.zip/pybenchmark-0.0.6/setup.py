When measuring execution time, the result depends on the computer hardware.
To be able to produce a universal measure, the simplest way is to benchmark the speed of a fixed sequence
of code and calculate a ratio out of it. From there, the time taken by a function can be translated to a
universal value that can be compared on any computer. Python provides a benchmark utility in its test
package that measures the duration of a sequence of well-chosen operations.
pybenchmark designed to provide a simple and pythonic way to get performance data.
