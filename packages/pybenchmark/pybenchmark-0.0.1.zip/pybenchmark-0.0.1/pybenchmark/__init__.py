"""
Performance utility functional used in performance tests.

When measuring execution time, the result depends on the computer hardware.
To be able to produce a universal measure, the simplest way is to benchmark the
speed of a fixed sequence of code and calculate a ratio out of it. From there, the time
taken by a function can be translated to a universal value that can be compared on
any computer. Python provides a benchmark utility in its test package that measures the duration
of a sequence of well-chosen operations.
