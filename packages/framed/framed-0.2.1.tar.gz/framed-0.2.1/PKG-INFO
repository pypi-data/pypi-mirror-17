Description: FRAMED
        ~~~~~~
        
        FRAMED (**FRA**\ mework for **M**\ etabolic **E**\ ngineering and
        **D**\ esign) is a python package for analysis and simulation of
        metabolic models.
        
        This package is continuously under development. Some of the current
        functionality includes:
        
        -  Import/Export of SBML files (constraint-based and kinetic models)
        -  Import/Export from plain text (constraint-based only)
        -  Simulation methods: FBA, pFBA, MOMA, linearMOMA, ROOM, loopless-FBA,
           dynamicFBA (single and multi-species)
        -  Analysis tools: FVA, PhPP, production envelope plotting, gene
           essentiality analysis
        -  Reconstruction: gapFind, gapFill
        -  Rational strain design: combinatorial, greedy (gene and
           reaction-based)
        -  Omics integration: GIMME, E-Flux
        -  Kinetic models (experimental support): time-course and steady-state
           simulation, sampling, plotting utils
