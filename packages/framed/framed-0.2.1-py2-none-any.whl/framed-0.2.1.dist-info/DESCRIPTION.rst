FRAMED
~~~~~~

FRAMED (**FRA**\ mework for **M**\ etabolic **E**\ ngineering and
**D**\ esign) is a python package for analysis and simulation of
metabolic models.

This package is continuously under development. Some of the current
functionality includes:

-  Import/Export of SBML files (constraint-based and kinetic models)
-  Import/Export from plain text (constraint-based only)
-  Simulation methods: FBA, pFBA, MOMA, linearMOMA, ROOM, loopless-FBA,
   dynamicFBA (single and multi-species)
-  Analysis tools: FVA, PhPP, production envelope plotting, gene
   essentiality analysis
-  Reconstruction: gapFind, gapFill
-  Rational strain design: combinatorial, greedy (gene and
   reaction-based)
-  Omics integration: GIMME, E-Flux
-  Kinetic models (experimental support): time-course and steady-state
   simulation, sampling, plotting utils
