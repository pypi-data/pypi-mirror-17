Description: GeomEppy
        ========
        
        |PyPI| from PyPI
        
        |Build Status| for Python 2.7 on Linux via Travis
        
        |CodeCov| via CodeCov
        
        GeomEppy is a scripting language for use with Eppy, which in turn is a
        scripting language for EnergyPlus IDF files and output files.
        
        API
        ---
        
        The API for GeomEppy depends on replacing an Eppy IDF object with a
        GeomEppy IDF object. To use this, you will need to import IDF from
        GeomEppy rather than directly from Eppy.
        
        In your scripts, use ``from geomeppy import IDF`` instead of
        ``from eppy.modeleditor import IDF``. All other features of the current
        release version of Eppy will still be available.
        
        GeomEppy then provides a simple Python API for actions on the IDF
        object:
        
        -  Intersecting and matching surfaces
        
        ``IDF.intersect()  # intersects all surfaces``
        
        ``IDF.match()  # sets boundary conditions of surfaces``
        
        ``IDF.intersect_match()  # intersect surfaces then set/update boundary conditions``
        
        -  Adding windows to external walls
        
        ``IDF.set_wwr(wwr=0.25)  # set a WWR of 25% for all external walls``
        
        -  Viewing a simple 3D representation of an IDF
        
        ``IDF.view_model()  # shows a zoomable, rotatable transparent model``
        
        ``IDF.add_block(...)  # automatically adds a building block to the IDF``
        
        This method requires some explanation. The parameters required are:
        
        ::
        
            coordinates : list
                A list of (x, y) tuples representing the building outline.
            height : float
                The height of the block roof above ground level.
            num_stories : int, optional
                The total number of stories including basement stories. Default : 1.
            below_ground_stories : int, optional
                The number of stories below ground. Default : 0.
            below_ground_storey_height : float, optional
                The height of each basement storey. Default : 2.5.
            zoning : str, optional
                The rules to use in creating zones. Currently the only option is `by_storey` which sets each storey in the block as a Zone.
        
        The block generated will have boundary conditions set correctly and any
        intersections with adjacent blocks will be handled automatically. The
        surface type will be set to ``wall``, ``floor``, ``ceiling`` or ``roof``
        for each surface. Constructions are not set automatically so these will
        need to be added afterwards in the normal way for Eppy.
        
        GeomEppy also provides some additional functions such as
        ``surface.setcoords(...)``
        
        ::
        
            wall = idf.newidfobject(
                'BUILDINGSURFACE:DETAILED', 'awall',
                Surface_Type = 'wall')
            wall.setcoords([(0,0,1),(0,0,0),(1,0,0),(1,0,1)])
        
        Forthcoming
        -----------
        
        -  Scaling and rotating buildings and blocks
        -  Geometry validation and correction
        -  Geometry simplification
        -  Better geometry visualisation
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Installing GeomEppy for Python 2.7 is a simple as calling
        ``pip install geomeppy``.
        
        Python 3 is currently unsupported while we await a fully-compatible
        version of Eppy to be released to PyPI.
