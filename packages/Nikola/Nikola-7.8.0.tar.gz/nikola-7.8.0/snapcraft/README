The folders edge/stable contain the files needed to build a snap package for Nikola.
Edge will build from master, stable from the latest release.

To build, in Ubuntu 16.04:

apt install snapd snapcraft
snap login some.account@whatever.com
./build.sh

To just use it:

apt install snapd
snap login some.account@whatever.com
snap install nikola


That should leave you with a working "nikola" command (/snap/bin/nikola if /snap/bin is not in your $PATH),
which is functional with the following caveats:

* Locales are a bit broken: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1576411
* The -b option in nikola serve and nikola auto will not work (need to use snap-xdg-open it seems)
* Plugin installation is tricky
* Your site needs to live in your home
* You can't use "nikola deploy".
* Probaby other things I have not noticed yet.
