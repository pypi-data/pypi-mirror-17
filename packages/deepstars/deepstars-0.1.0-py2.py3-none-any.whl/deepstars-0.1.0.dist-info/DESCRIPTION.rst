Supernovae classifying and redshifting software: development stage


1. How to install:

    Install tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#download-and-setup).
    Run GUI/main.py
    Once open, type in a known redshift
    Browse for any single spectrum FITS, ASCII, dat, or two-column text file.
    Click any of the best matches to view the continuum-subtracted binned spectra.
    If the input spectrum is too noisy, increase the smoothing level, and click 'Re-fit with priors'


2. Dependencies:
    python2.7 (unconfirmed python3)
    numpy
    scipy
    PyQt4
    tensorflow
