        <p>A data element concept represents the union of an [[objectclass]] and a
        [[property]]. Examples of data element concepts include concepts such as,
        <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>date of birth</em>, <em>Person</em> &mdash;
        <em>country of birth</em>, and <em>Person</em> &mdash; <em>religious
        affiliation</em>.</p>
        
        <p>A data element concept is solely a conceptual description
        and does not include values for measurement or collection.
        Values are described by a [[valuedomain]], which in combination with
        the data element concept forms a [[dataelement]].</p>
        
        <p>A [[conceptualdomain]] may also be associated with a data element concept,
        thereby providing meaning to the values associated with the concept.
        A one-to-many relationship may be formed between a data element concept
        and suitable conceptual domains.</p>
