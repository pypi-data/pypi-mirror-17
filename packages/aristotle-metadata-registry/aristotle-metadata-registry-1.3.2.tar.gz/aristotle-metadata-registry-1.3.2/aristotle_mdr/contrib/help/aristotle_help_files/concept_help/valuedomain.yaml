    brief: A definition of how to record the measurement a particular attribute, either
        using a coded list of values or a description of the possible values.
    offical_definition: a set of Permissible Values
    official_reference: ISO/IEC 11179 - Clause 3.2.140

    body: >
        <p>A value domain provides a set of permissible values by which a [[data element]]
        can be implemented. Value domains can be enumerated (e.g. Total centimetres NNN)
        or non-enumerated (e.g. Sex code N).</p>
        
            <p>The union of a specific value domain with a specific [[data element concept]]
            creates a [[data element]]. For example the data element concept
            <em>Person&mdash;body height</em> can be implemented through union
            with the <em>Total centimetres NNN</em> value domain. </p>

        <p>ISO/IEC 11179 allows for 2 different types of Value Domains - enumerated vs non-enumerated.
        The distinction between these is that an enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a list of all its Value Meanings</q>,
        while a non-enumerated value domain is <q>specified by a description rather than a list of all Permissible Values</q>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a enumerated value domain</em> would be a list of 10-year cohorts for recording a persons age:
                <ul>
                    <li> A code of A coresponsing to 0-15 years
                    <li> A code of B coresponsing to 15-30 years
                    <li> A code of C coresponsing to 30-45 years
                    <li> A code of D coresponsing to 45+ years
                </ul>
                Here, every possible value within the set has been explicitly enumerated.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>An example of a non-enumerated value domain</em> would be an numeric range for recording a persons age,
                where the number could be any two digit number greater than zero. While there is an implied set of values, these have not been expressly enumerated.
