    body: >
        <p>A data element derivation is a formal description of how a particular
        [[data element]] can be calculated based on the values of other
        data elements.
        </p>
        <p>For example, a data element describing a
        <em>Person-Body Mass Index, BMI Value</em> can be derived from
        the data elements <em>Person-Weight, Kg</em> and
        <em>Person-Height, cm</em> according to the derivation rule
        <tt>BMI = Weight/Height<sup>2</sup></tt>.
