Description: What PyLogit is
        ============
        
        PyLogit is a Python package for performing maximum likelihood estimation of conditional logit models and similar logit-like models.
        
        Main Features
        ===========
        
        * Conditional Logit Models
        * Supports datasets where the choice set differs across observations
        * Supports model specifications where the coefficient for a given variable may be
           - completely alternative-specific (i.e. one coefficient per alternative, subject to identification of the coefficients),
           - subset-specific (i.e. one coefficient per subset of alternatives, where each alternative belongs to only one subset, and there are more than 1 but less than J subsets, where J is the maximum number of available alternatives in the dataset),
           - completely generic (i.e. one coefficient across all alternatives).
