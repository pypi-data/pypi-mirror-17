@name:      Mixed MultiNomial Logit
@author:    Timothy Brathwaite
@summary:   Contains functions necessary for estimating mixed multinomial logit
            models (with the help of the "base_multinomial_cm.py" file).
            Version 1 only works for MNL kernels and only for mixing of index
            coefficients.

    Parameters
    ----------
    init_vals : 1D ndarray.
        1D numpy array of the initial values to start the optimizatin process
        with. There should be one value for each index coefficient being
        estimated.
    design_3d : 2D ndarray.
        2D numpy array with one row per observation per available alternative.
        There should be one column per index coefficient being estimated. All
        elements should be ints, floats, or longs.
    alt_id_vector : 1D ndarray.
        All elements should be ints. There should be one row per observation
        per available alternative for the given observation. Elements denote
        the alternative corresponding to the given row of the design matrix.
    choice_vector : 1D ndarray.
        All elements should be either ones or zeros. There should be one row
        per observation per available alternative for the given observation.
        Elements denote the alternative which is chosen by the given
        observation with a 1 and a zero otherwise.
    constrained_pos : list or None, optional.
        Denotes the positions of the array of estimated parameters that are not
        to change from their initial values. If a list is passed, the elements
        are to be integers where no such integer is is greater than
        init_values.size.
    print_res : bool, optional.
        Determines whether the timing and initial and final log likelihood
        results will be printed as they they are determined. Default = True.
    method : str, optional.
        Should be a valid string which can be passed to
        scipy.optimize.minimize. Determines the optimization algorithm which is
        used for this problem. Default = 'newton-cg'.
    loss_tol : float, optional.
        Determines the tolerance on the difference in objective function values
        from one iteration to the next which is needed to determine
        convergence. Default = 1e-06.
    gradient_tol : float, optional.
        Determines the tolerance on the difference in gradient values from one
        iteration to the next which is needed to determine convergence.

        Default = 1000.
    ridge : int, float, long, or None. OPTIONAl.
        Determines whether or not ridge regression is performed. If a scalar is
        passed, then that scalar determines the ridge penalty for the
        optimization. Default = None.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : string or pandas dataframe.
        If string, data should be an absolute or relative path to a CSV
        file containing the long format data for this choice model. Note
        long format has one row per available alternative for each
        observation. If pandas dataframe, the dataframe should be the long
        format data for the choice model.
    alt_id_col : str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the alternative
        identifiers for each row.
    obs_id_col : str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the observation
        identifiers for each row.
    choice_col : str.
        Should denote the column in data which contains the ones and zeros
        that denote whether or not the given row corresponds to the chosen
        alternative for the given individual.
    specification : OrderedDict.
        Keys are a proper subset of the columns in long_form_df. Values are
        either a list or a single string, `all_diff` or `all_same`. If a
        list, the elements should be one of the following:

        - single objects that are within the alternative ID
          column of long_form_df
        - lists of objects that are within the alternative
          ID column of long_form_df.

        For each single object in the list, a unique column will be created
        (i.e. there will be a unique coefficient for that variable in the
        corresponding utility equation of the corresponding alternative).
        For lists within the specification_dict values, a single column
        will be created for all the alternatives within iterable (i.e.
        there will be one common coefficient for the variables in the
        iterable).
    names : OrderedDict, optional.
        Should have the same keys as `specification_dict`. For each key:

        - if the corresponding value in specification_dict is "all_same",
          then there should be a single string as the value in names.
        - if the corresponding value in specification_dict is "all_diff",
          then there should be a list of strings as the value in names.
          There should be one string in the value in names for each
        - if the corresponding value in specification_dict is a list, then
          there should be a list of strings as the value in names. There
          should be one string in the value in names per item in the value
          in specification_dict. Default == None.

    Methods
    -------
    panel_predict(new_data, num_draws, return_long_probs, choice_col, seed)
        Predicts the probability of each individual in `new_data` making each
        possible choice in each choice situation they are faced with. This
        method differs from the `predict()` function by using 'individualized
        coefficient distributions' that are conditioned on each person's past
        choices and choice situations (if there are any).
