Description: What PyLogit is
        ===============
        PyLogit is a Python package for performing maximum likelihood estimation of conditional logit models and similar logit-like models.
        
        Main Features
        =============
        
        * Conditional Logit (Type) Models
        
           - Multinomial Logit Models
           - Multinomial Asymmetric Models
        
              + Multinomial Clog-log Model
              + Multinomial Scobit Model
              + Multinomial Uneven Logit Model
              + Multinomial Asymmetric Logit Model
           - Nested Logit Models
           - Mixed Logit Models (with Normal mixing distributions)
        
        * Supports datasets where the choice set differs across observations
        * Supports model specifications where the coefficient for a given variable may be
        
           - completely alternative-specific (i.e. one coefficient per alternative, subject to identification of the coefficients),
           - subset-specific (i.e. one coefficient per subset of alternatives, where each alternative belongs to only one subset, and there are more than 1 but less than J subsets, where J is the maximum number of available alternatives in the dataset),
           - completely generic (i.e. one coefficient across all alternatives). 
        
        Where to get it
        ===============
        Available from PyPi
            https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylogit/0.1.0
        
        Available through Anaconda::
            conda install -c timothyb0912 pylogit
