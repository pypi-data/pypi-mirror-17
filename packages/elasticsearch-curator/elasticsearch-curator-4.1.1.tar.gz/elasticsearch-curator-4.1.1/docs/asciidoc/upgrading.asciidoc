== Upgrading

If Curator has been installed via `pip`, the preferred way to upgrade is:

-------------------------------------
pip install -U elasticsearch-curator
-------------------------------------

If you need to manually upgrade, follow the
<<installation,installation instructions>> for installing from source to obtain
the most recent versions of both elasticsearch-py and Curator.

You should then be able to run:

-------------------------------------
pip install -U elasticsearch-py.tar.gz
-------------------------------------

&nbsp;

and then:

-------------------------------------
pip install -U elasticsearch-curator.tar.gz
-------------------------------------

If Curator has been installed via package repository, then use the standard
upgrade method for your repository.
