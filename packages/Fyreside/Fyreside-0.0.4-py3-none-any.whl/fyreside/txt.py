Welcome to Fireside!
built using qtMUD 0.0.8

Fireside is a talker-style MUD where you gain action points for how much you
talk, and can use those to "play" cards in your "hand".

If you don't like the hand you were dealt, "discard" and "draw" to try and
get different ones, but note that you can only have up to five cards in your
hand at a time.

Type "commands" to see a list of commands, and "help" for more information."""
