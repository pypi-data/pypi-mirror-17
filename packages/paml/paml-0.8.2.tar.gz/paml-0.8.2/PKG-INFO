Description: PAML is a simple HTML/XML shorthand syntax in the same spirit as HAML or SLIP.
        It was designed to be faithful to the HTML/XML syntax while reducing the
        opportunities for errors (like forgetting to close a block). PAML also
        supports advanced formatting options to get exactly the HTML you want to have.
