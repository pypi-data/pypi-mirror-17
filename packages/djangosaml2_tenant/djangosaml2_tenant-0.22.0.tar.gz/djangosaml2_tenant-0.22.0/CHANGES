Changes
=======

0.20.0 (2015-02-12)
-------------------
- Initial version based on djangosaml2 supporting multi-tenant

0.20.1 (2016-04-06)
- Make djangosaml2 tenant support reading metadata from database by adding the following to settings.py:
    SAML_CONFIG.update({
        # Specifying 'inline': 'DB' means SAML metadata comes from the DB via the following method:
        # tenant/models/Member.get_saml_metadata(self)
        # Implement this method to retrieve the metadata from the table of your choice.
        'metadata': {
            'inline': 'DB',
        },
        ...
    })

0.22.0 (2016-08-29)
- Removed the logic of loading metadata from database model tenant.Member. Projects using this app can specify
  their own config loader using the SAML_CONFIG_LOADER setting. This change provides more flexibility in-terms
  of loading config from any data-source.
- Also, removed the caching of service provider config objects as per the same logic as above. Individual
  projects using this app can use their own config loader which handles caching scenarios.
