# The only HTML file we serve that isn't a template, index.html, should have an
# etag and be checked each time.  Items inside all have a version as part of the
# filename, so reloading this one HTML file updates the site.
#
# All vendor files should have the version manually appended when adding to the
# project or upgrading versions.
#
# To ensure an incremental build that only updates one of the generated files
# works, the build scripts should always regenerate the index HTML too.

# WARNING
# -------
#
# Python's asyncio does not have an asynchronous way to read files because operating systems
# don't really support it.  Apparently *nix systems have the API (select with file descriptors)
# but they always report themselves ready and therefore end up blocking anyway.
#
# Python will soon (or may already) support an asynchronous sendfile, which would could try to
# use.
#
# To work around this, we'll simply cache the files in memory.  Due to reference counting,
# Python is usually very good with memory.  The library is really designed for single page
# applications where resources are cached at the browser for a year.  (Put your version number
# on the end!)

# TODO ITEMS
# ----------
#
# We have not implemented compression yet.  I don't believe there are any modern browsers that
# don't support gzip, so we should only support compression and hold the compressed version in
# memory.
#
# Add a way to register mimetypes.  (Or perhaps use a module that already has them?)
