Python 3 VCF parser that allows both reading and writing

* Free software: MIT license

Why another VCF parser for Python!
----------------------------------

I've been using PyVCF with quite some success in the past.
However, the main bottleneck of PyVCF is when you want to modify the per-sample genotype information.
There are some issues in the tracker of PyVCF but none of them can really be considered solved.
I tried several hours to solve these problems within PyVCF but this never got far or towards a complete rewrite...

For this reason, VCFPy was born and here it is!

What's the State?
-----------------

VCFPy is the result of two full days of development plus some maintenance work later now (right now).
I'm using it in several projects but it is not as battle-tested as PyVCF.

Why Python 3 Only?
------------------

As I'm only using Python 3 code, I see no advantage in carrying around support for legacy Python 2 and maintaining it.
At a later point when VCFPy is known to be stable, Python 2 support might be added if someone contributes a pull request.
