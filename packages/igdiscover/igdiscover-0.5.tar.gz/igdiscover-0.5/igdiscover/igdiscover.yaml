## IgDiscover configuration

library_name:

# Choose a species support by IgBLAST, such as 'human', 'mouse' or 'rhesus_monkey'
species: human


# How many discovery iterations to run.
# If 0, the database will not be updated.
iterations: 3


# If you have a random barcode sequence (unique molecular identifier) at the 5' end,
# set this to its length. Leave at 0 when you have no 5' barcode.
barcode_length_5prime: 0

# Same as above, but for the 3' end of the sequence. Leave at 0 when you have no 3' barcode.
# Currently, you cannot have a barcode in both ends, so at least one of the two settings
# must be zero.
barcode_length_3prime: 0


## Primer-related settings

# If set to true, it is assumed that the forward primer is always at the 5' end
# of the first read and that the reverse primer is always at the 5' end of the
# second read. If it can also be the other way, set this to false.
# This setting has no effect if no primer sequences are defined below.
stranded: false

# When discovering new V genes, ignore whether a J gene has been assigned
# and also ignore its %SHM.
#  true: yes, ignore the J
#  false: do not ignore J assignment, do not ignore its %SHM

# Read merging program. Choose either 'pear' or 'flash'.
# pear merges more reads, but is slower.
#
#merge_program: pear


# Which program to use for computing multiple alignments. This is used for
# computing consens sequences.
# Choose 'mafft', 'clustalo', 'muscle' or 'muscle-fast'.

# When clustering sequences to discover new genes, subsample to this number of
# sequences. Higher is slower.
#
subsample: 1000


# Which program to use for clustering. Use vsearch or usearch (can also be an
# absolute path).

#cluster_program: vsearch


# Filter out reads that have more than this number of expected errors.
# Set to null to disable.
#
#maximum_expected_errors: null

# Do not mention the original FASTA or FASTQ sequence names in the
# assigned.tab files, but instead use names <library_name>_seq<number>,
# where <number> is a running number starting at 1.
#  true: yes, rename
#  false: no, do not rename
#
rename: true


# The "seed value" is in arbitrary number used to get reproducible
# runs. Two runs that use the same software version, the same seed
# and otherwise the same configuration will give identical results.
#
# Set this to false in order to use a different seed each run.
# The results will then be not exactly reproducible.

seed: 1
