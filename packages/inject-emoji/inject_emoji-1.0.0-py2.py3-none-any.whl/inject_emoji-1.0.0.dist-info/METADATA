Description: :sparkles::syringe::sparkles: inject-emoji
        ==========================================
        
        |Build Status|
        
        A simple script to replace `emoji <http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com>`__
        string notation such as ``:simple_smile:`` with an HTML image tag. By
        default, ``inject-emoji`` reads from ``STDIN``, and writes to
        ``STDOUT``.
        
        About
        -----
        
        So many offline GitHub Flavored Markdown renderers, yet so few with
        GitHub Flavored Markdown Emoji. Until now.
        
        The Interface
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ``inject-emoji`` is available both as a Python module and a command-line
        application (powered by Python).
        
        The Python Module
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        ***injectemoji.InjectEmoji([Input FileObj], [Output FileObj],
        [emoji\_directory])*** If input and/or output FileObjects are provided,
        they will be used accordingly. If none are provided, ``sys.stdin`` and
        ``sys.stdout``, respectively, will be used. If an emoji directory (say,
        from your own checkout of
        `WebpageFX/emoji-cheat-sheet.com <https://github.com/WebpageFX/emoji-cheat-sheet.com/>`__),
        the substitutions provided to the regular expression in ``inject-emoji``
        will be a reflection of the filenames in that directory.
        
        The CLI Tool
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        .. code:: text
        
            usage: inject-emoji [-h] [-o FILE] [-d EMOJI_DIR] [FILE]
        
            Convert emoji-cheat-sheet notation to HTML image tags.
        
            positional arguments:
              FILE                  Read from FILE instead of stdin
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -o FILE, --output FILE
                                    Write to FILE instead of stdout
              -d EMOJI_DIR, --dir EMOJI_DIR
                                    Read emoji directory listing from EMOJI_DIR instead of
                                    bundled emoji
        
        The Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install inject-emoji
        
        The RegEx
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        The regular expression match is Python-flavored. The shorthand view of
        it is:
        
        ::
        
            (?<!`)(:([\-\+a-z0-9_]+):)(?!`)
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claylo/inject-emoji/master/media/mR9lztEVrnVQB463.png

        `Debuggex Demo <https://www.debuggex.com/r/mR9lztEVrnVQB463>`__
        
        However, in the source itself, all 800+ emoji names are compiled into
        the regex.
        
        The Why
        ~~~~~~~
        
        I wrote this script to enhance Github Flavored Markdown generated by
        `Marked 2 <http://marked2app.com>`__. To use it with Marked 2, configure
        it as a preprocessor like so:
        
        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claylo/inject-emoji/master/media/preprocessor-marked2.png
