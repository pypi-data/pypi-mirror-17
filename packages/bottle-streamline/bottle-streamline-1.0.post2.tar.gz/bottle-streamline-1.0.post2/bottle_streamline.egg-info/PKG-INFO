        This project is a collection of classes for writing complex, modullar, and/or
        reusable route handlers using `bottle <http://bottlepy.org>`_ web framework.
        
        Even though 'complex route handlers' may seem like an oximoron, there may be
        situations where support for multiple parameters are needed or where a simple
        branching in the route handler code may completely change the logic of your 
        route handler. If you find yourself running into this type of situation and
        struggle to organize the code, you may find bottle-streamline is a good fit for
        your project.
        
        Quick example
        =============
        
        Example of a classic Hello world app::
        
            import bottle
            from streamline import RouteBase
        
        
            class Hello(BaseRoute):
                def get(self):
                    return 'Hello world!'
        
        
            Hello.route('/')
            bottle.run()
