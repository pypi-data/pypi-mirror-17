Minchin dot CA Theme
====================

``Minchin dot CA`` is a theme for `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_,
a static site generator written in Python.

The ``Minchin dot CA`` theme is based on Bootstrap 3, and was first used at
`Minchin.ca <http://minchin.ca>`_. 

Installation
============

The easiest way to install the ``Minchin dot CA`` theme is through the use
of pip. This will also install the required dependencies automatically.

.. code-block:: sh

  pip install minchin.pelican.themes.minchindotca

Then, in your ``pelicanconf.py`` file, import the modele, use the
built in function to specify your theme location, set the default
colour scheme, set the image processing patterns used, and add some Jinja
filters that the theme uses:

.. code-block:: python

  from minchin.pelican.themes import minchindotca

  THEME = minchindotca.get_path()
  BOOTSTRAP_THEME = 'minchindotca'

  IMAGE_PROCESS = {
    'article-feature': ["scale_in 848 848 True"],
    'index-feature': ["scale_in 263 263 True"],
  }

  # Jijna2 filters
  def datetimefilter(value, format='%Y/%m/%d %H:%M'):
      """convert a datetime to a different format."""
      return value.strftime(format)


  def article_date(value):
      """Converts a date to the format we want it displayed on the article
         template.
      """
      return value.strftime('%A, %B %-d, %Y')


  def breaking_spaces(value):
      """Converts non-breaking spaces to regular spaces."""
      return value.replace('\u00A0', ' ')


  JINJA_FILTERS = {
    'datetimefilter': datetimefilter,
    'article_date':   article_date,
    'breaking_spaces': breaking_spaces,
  }


You will may also need to configure the theme through the use of additional
settings (see below).


Requirements
============

``Minchin dot ca`` requires Pelican and the ``image_process`` plugin.
This can be manually installed with pip:

.. code-block:: sh

   pip install pelican minchin.pelican.plugins.image_process
