Description: Alignak checks package for the monitoring plugins
        =================================================
        
        Checks pack for checking a lot of services: Dns, Http, Dhcp, ...
        
        This checks pack is based upon the checks of the `Monitoring Plugins Project<https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/faq/installation.html>`_.
        
        This project is a bundle of around 50 standard plugins for monitoring applications.
        Some plugins allow to monitor local system metrics, others use various network protocols for remote checks.
        
        *Our bundle was previously known as the “official” Nagios Plugins package.*
        *The new name reflects both the success of the straightforward plugin interface originally invented*
        *by the Nagios folks, and the popularity of our package, as the plugins are now used with various other monitoring products as well.*

        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To use this checks package, you must first install some external plugins.
        We recommand that you download and install the Monitoring plugins: https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/download.html
        
        Check if it exists a binary package for your OS distribution rather than compiling and installing from source.
        Else, the source installation procedure is explained `here<https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/faq/installation.html>`_.
        An abstract::
        
            $ gzip -dc monitoring-plugins-2.x.tar.gz | tar -xf -
            $ cd monitoring-plugins-2.x
            $ ./configure
            $ make
        
            $ make install
        
            $ make install-root
            $ # This for plugins requiring setuid (check_icmp ...)
        
        After compilation and installation, the plugins are installed in the */usr/local/libexec* directory.
        
        The */usr/local/etc/alignak/arbiter/packs/resource.d/monitoring.cfg* file defines a global macro
        that contains the monitoring plugins installation path. If you do not install as default, edit
        this file to update the path
        ::
        
            #-- Monitoring plugins installation directory
            $MONITORING_PLUGINS_DIR$=/usr/local/libexec
            #--
        
        
        Alignak configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You simply have to tag the concerned hosts with the template you are interested in.
        ::
        
            define host{
                use                     dns, ftp, http
                host_name               my_host
                address                 127.0.0.1
            }
        
        
        
        Each template declares the associated services on the concerned host.
        You can easily adapt the configuration defined in the ``templates.cfg``, ``services.cfg`` and ``commands.cfg`` files.
