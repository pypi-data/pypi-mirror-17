Introduction
============

This product uses Products.ContentWellPortlets to place a sitemap-portlet
above the columns and gives the dropdown-effect via CSS.

This way, your folder structure will be mirrowed in the dropdown.

The depth and target-folder can be configured via the sitemap-portlets
web-user-interface, just like Plone's standard navigation-portlets.

Includes responsive design for dektop-, tablet- and mobile-devices.
