Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This product uses Products.ContentWellPortlets to place a sitemap-portlet
        above the columns and gives the dropdown-effect via CSS.
        
        This way, your folder structure will be mirrowed in the dropdown.
        
        The depth and target-folder can be configured via the sitemap-portlets
        web-user-interface, just like Plone's standard navigation-portlets.
        
        Includes responsive design for dektop-, tablet- and mobile-devices.
        
        
        Installation
