About RIOS
==========

RIOS (Resource Investment Optimization System)  is a free and open source
software tool that supports the design of cost-effective investments in
watershed services.

RIOS provides a standardized, science-based approach to watershed management in
contexts throughout the world. It combines biophysical, social, and economic
data to help users identify the best locations for protection and restoration
activities in order to maximize the ecological return on investment, within the
bounds of what is socially and politically feasible.

RIOS was developed through an extensive stakeholder engagement process,
including input from more than 11 water funds (watershed investment programs)
across Latin America. The tool has been tested in diverse ecological, social and
political contexts. Early applications in the Cauca Valley of Colombia resulted
in RIOS-designed watershed investments up to six times more effective than
typical investment approaches. RIOS enables watershed investors to use a
replicable, transparent, and stakeholder-driven approach to evaluate projects
within a region or between regions, making it easier to track the places where
their investments are most needed and most effective.

Questions RIOS can answer
-------------------------

* Which set of watershed investments (in which activities, and where) will yield the greatest returns towards multiple objectives?

* What change in ecosystem services can I expect from these investments?

* How do the benefits of these investments compare to what would have been achieved under an alternate investment strategy?
