|Deploy to Docker Cloud|

Getting started
===============

Create a new ICEkit project in the given directory (default:
``icekit-project``):

::

    $ bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ic-labs/django-icekit/master/icekit/bin/startproject.sh) [destination_dir]

All other commands in this document should be run from the project
directory.

NOTE: Windows users should run this command in Git Bash, which comes
with `Git for Windows <https://git-for-windows.github.io/>`__.

Run with Docker
===============

The easiest way to run an ICEkit project is with Docker. It works on OS
X, Linux, and Windows, takes care of all the project dependencies like
the database and search engine, and makes deployment easy.

If you haven't already, go install Docker:

-  `OS X <https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg>`__
-  `Linux <https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/>`__
-  `Windows <https://download.docker.com/win/stable/InstallDocker.msi>`__

Build an image and start the project:

::

    $ docker-compose build --pull
    $ docker-compose up  # Watch for the admin account credentials that get created on first run

This will take a few minutes the first time. When you see the following
message, you will know it is ready:

::

    #
    # READY.
    #

Now you can open the site in a browser:

::

    http://icekit.lvh.me:8000  # *.lvh.me is a wildcard DNS that maps to 127.0.0.1

Read our `Docker Quick Start <docs/docker-quick-start.md>`__ guide for
more info on running an ICEkit project with Docker.

Run without Docker
==================

Read our `Manual Setup <docs/manual-setup.md>`__ guide for more info on
running an ICEkit project without Docker.

Deploy to Docker Cloud
======================

Use the Deploy to Docker Cloud button above to create a new ICEkit stack
on `Docker Cloud <https://cloud.docker.com/>`__.

You won't be able to `customise your
project <#customise-your-project>`__ when deploying the official ICEkit
Docker image this way.

Configure your project
======================

You will need to provide some basic information to configure your
project.

You can do so with environment variables, or by editing the
``docker-cloud.yml`` and ``icekit_settings.py`` files.

All settings are optional, but you can provide:

-  ``BASE_SETTINGS_MODULE`` tells ICEkit to run in ``develop`` or
   ``production`` mode.

-  ``EMAIL_HOST``, ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`` and ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``, so
   ICEkit can send emails (only in ``production`` mode).

   We recommend `Mailgun <http://www.mailgun.com/>`__, but any SMTP
   credentials will do.

-  ``MASTER_PASSWORD`` (only in ``develop`` mode) so you can login as
   any user with the same password.

-  ``MEDIA_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``, ``MEDIA_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` and
   ``MEDIA_AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`` so ICEkit can store file uploads
   `Amazon S3 <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__.

   The specified bucket should already exist, or the credentials
   provided should have permission to create buckets. This is especially
   important when deploying to ephemeral infrastructure, like Docker
   Cloud.

-  ``PGDATABASE``, ``PGHOST``, ``PGPASSWORD``, ``PGPORT`` and
   ``PGUSER``, if you need to connect to provide credentials for your
   PostgreSQL database.

   We recommend `Amazon RDS <https://aws.amazon.com/rds/>`__, especially
   when deploying to ephemeral infrastructure, like Docker Cloud.

-  ``SENTRY_DSN``, if you want to use
   `Sentry <https://getsentry.com/>`__ for real-time error tracking.

-  ``SITE_DOMAIN`` and ``SITE_NAME``, so ICEkit knows how to generate
   redirects correctly and knows what to call your site.

Customise your project
======================

Anything you put in the ``static`` or ``templates`` directory will
override the default ICEkit static files and templates.

You can specify additional Bower components in ``bower.json``, Node
modules in ``package.json``, and Python packages in
``requirements.txt``.

The ``icekit_settings.py`` file is a Django settings module. You can
override any default ICEkit settings or configure apps installed via
``requirements.txt``.
