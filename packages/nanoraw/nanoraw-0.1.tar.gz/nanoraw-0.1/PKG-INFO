Description: ## Summary
        This package provides tools for the analysis of raw nanopore sequencing data, including correction of basecalls and visualization.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - HDF5 (<http://micro.stanford.edu/wiki/Install_HDF5#Install>)
        - graphmap (<https://github.com/isovic/graphmap>)
        
        #### python Requirements:
        - python
        - numpy
        - h5py
        - rpy2
        
        #### R Requirements:
        - R
        - ggplot2 (not actually enfored on install, but plotting commands will fail; install with `install.packages('ggplot2')` from an R prompt)
        
        #### Optionally:
        - changepoint (for using R's changepoint package for re-segmentation)
        - Biopython (for robust FASTA parsing, but a simple parser is provided)
        
        ## Installation
        Install nanoraw via pip
        ```
        pip install nanoraw
        ```
        
        Install bleeding edge via github
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/marcus1487/nanoraw.git
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        nanoraw -h
        nanoraw [command] [options]
        ```
        
        ### Commands:
        #### Main comands:
        - correct: Correct annotation of raw signal with genomic aignement of existing basecalls
        - write_wiggle: Write wiggle file of genome coverage.
        
        #### Plotting comands:
        - plot_signal: Plot signal across selected genomic regions.
        - plot_comparison: Plot comparison of two read groups.
        - plot_kmer: Plot signal quantiles acorss kmers.
