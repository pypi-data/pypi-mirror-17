    The target function executes on a different python interpreter under a low
    privilege user. Everything is serialized and transmitted to the sandbox
    using either pickle, json or some other serialization protocol.

    The input arguments and return value must be serializable using the given
    protocol and any modification that the target function makes to the input
    arguments is not transmitted back from the function call.

    Args:
        target
            Callable that shall be executed in the sandbox.
        args, kwargs
            Position and named arguments passed to the callable.
        timeout
            The maximum allowed time in seconds. If no timeout is given, there will
            be no time limits for execution.
        method
            The sandboxing strategy. For now, only the 'simple' strategy is
            implemented.
        imports
            A list of modules that should be imported before lowering privileges.
            Remember that a low privilege user may not be able to import modules
            installed in the local user folders.
        serializer
            'json', 'pickle', 'dill' or 'cloudpickle'.

            The protocol used to transmit data from/to the sandbox. Going from
            JSON to cloudpickle we trade security with the ability to handle more
            argument types. Remember that malicious code can make pickle execute
            arbitrary data during unpickling (which is done outside the sandbox).
