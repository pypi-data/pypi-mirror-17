Introduction
************

The F5® agent translates from 'OpenStack' to 'F5®'. It uses the `f5-sdk <http://f5-sdk.readthedocs.io>`_ to translate OpenStack messaging calls -- such as those from the Neutron RPC messaging queue -- into iControl® REST calls to F5® technologies, such as BIG-IP®.

Documentation
*************

Documentation is published on Read the Docs, at http://f5-openstack-agent.readthedocs.io.

Compatibility
*************

The F5® OpenStack agent is compatible with OpenStack releases from Liberty forward. If you are using Kilo or earlier, you'll need the `LBaaSv1 plugin <http://f5-openstack-lbaasv1.readthedocs.io>`_.

See the `F5® OpenStack Releases and Support Matrix <http://f5-openstack-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases_and_versioning.html>`_ for more information.

Installation
************

Please see the `documentation <http://f5-openstack-agent.readthedocs.io>`_ for installation instructions.

For Developers
**************

Filing Issues
=============

If you find an issue, we would love to hear about it. Please open a new `issue <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-agent/issues>`_ aissue for each bug you'd like to report or feature you'd like to request. Please be specific, and include as much information about your environment and the issue as possible.

Contributing
************
See `Contributing <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

Test
****
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__ unit tests. In addition, you should
include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP® device
for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included
below.

Unit Tests
==========

We use pytest for our unit tests.

1. If you haven't already, install the required test packages and the
   requirements.txt in your virtual environment.

::

    $ pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the tests and produce a coverage report. The ``--cov-report=html`` will create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your browser to see the missing lines of code.

::

    $ py.test --cov ./icontrol --cov-report=html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Style Checks
============

We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of step 1 in the Unit Test section).

::

    $ flake8 ./

Troubleshooting
===============

When the f5-openstack-agent is installed, the *debug_bundler.py* script will be installed to */usr/bin/f5/*. This script can be run from the command line directly. It will search in the specified directories to bundle log files and configuration files for use in debugging an issue with the f5-openstack-agent. In addition to the above files, it also dumps a complete listing of the ``pip lists`` output.

**WARNING**

The files added to this bundle may contain VERY SENSITIVE INFORMATION such as encryption keys, passwords, and usernames. Do not upload this bundle, or any information within, to a public forum unless you have scrubbed sensitive information thoroughly. When in doubt, don't upload it at all.

Below you can see the basic usage, using the default command-line arguments:

::

    $ python /usr/bin/f5/debug_bundler.py /home/myuser/debug_bundle_output/

A tarred, compressed, file will be created in the directory specified. It will contain all logs and configuration files the script found. Note that the script offers a best-effort search of the directories given, and if it cannot find the log files it is looking for in those directories, it will print a message and continue running.

The default log location is set to `/var/log/neutron` and the default configuration file location is in `/etc/neutron`. These locations can be overriden via the command-line invocation shown below:

::

    $ python /usr/bin/f5/debug_bundler.py --log-dir=/var/log/mylogs --config-dir /etc/myconfigs/ ~/

If any issue is found with the debug_bundler script, please file an issue on GitHub.
