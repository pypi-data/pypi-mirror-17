   Tailsocket capture

You've set up your machine and you're tweaking config files to get it
just right, this last bit should do it... oh, it doesn't? Weird, where's
that log again? Hmm, I know it's in the history somewhere, or did I have
it on screen/tmux? Which one? :/

Say no more! ``pip install tailsocket``, run ``tailsocket-server``,
write the path to the log file *once* and let the logs come to you!

Ok, maybe I'm being a bit dramatic, but I've found this frustrating
sometimes and seemed like a good use for WebSockets so I put this little
project together using Tornado, asyncio and React.

Keep in mind Tailsocket can only read from files the owner of the
process can read from.

Issues
------

-  Changing a tailed log file does not show confirmation, simply new log
   entries.
-  Application messages and errors show in the same context as log
   entries.

Enhancements
------------

-  Globbing
-  Multiple log screens

Changelog
---------

-  *v0.1.1* - Use the more performant
   `pyinotify <https://github.com/seb-m/pyinotify>`__ in Linux platforms
   instead of a raw ``select`` event loop.
-  *v0.1* - Initial version.
