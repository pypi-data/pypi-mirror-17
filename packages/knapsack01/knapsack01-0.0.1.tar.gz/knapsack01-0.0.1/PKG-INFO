        Knapsack01
        --------------
        
        Generic 0-1 Knapsack Problem Solver.
        
            | Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, Knapsack01
            | determine the number of each item to include in a collection so
              that the
            | total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total
              value is
            | as large as possible.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        -  Python 3.4 (tested)
        
        Goal
        ----
        
        | The ultimate goal of this library is to provide a generic interface
        | for solving the Knapsack problem for variety of applications.
        
        Code sample
        -----------
        
        | Lets say, given the capacity (10) of a team and a list of Jira tickets
          with
        | story points and priorities, I would like to know what tickets I want
        | to do in the next sprint. Note that you can put multiple parameters
          for
        | evaluating the importance of each ticket.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from knapsack01.knapsack import Item
            from knapsack01.knapsack import Knapsack
        
            tickets = [
                Item('A', 1, [1, 4, 8, 23, 6]),
                Item('B', 3, [4]),
                Item('C', 4, [5]),
                Item('E', 5, [7])
            ]
            k = Knapsack(10)
            k.items = tickets
            jira_tickets_next_sprint = k.pick_items()
