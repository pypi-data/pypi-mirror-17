Description: ENIMDA
        ======
        
        ENtropy-based IMage border Detection Algorithm: finds out if your image has borders or whitespaces around and helps you to trim border providing whitespace offsets for every side of a picture.
        
        Supports GIF border detection and its cropping.
        
        Algorithm (simplified)
        ----------------------
        
        For each side of the image starting from top, rotating image counterclockwise
        to keep side of interest on top:
        
        * Get upper block 25% of image height
        * Get lower block with the same height as the upper one
        * Calculate entropy for both blocks and their difference
        * Make upper block 1px less
        * Repeat from p.2 until we hit image edge
        * Border is between blocks with entropy difference maximum

        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 3.5+
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            pip install enimda
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Find if image has any borders:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from enimda import ENIMDA
        
        
            # Load target image
            em = ENIMDA(fp='test.jpg')
        
            # Scan for borders with high precision
            em.scan(fast=False)
        
            # Save image with outlined borders for demonstration
            em.outline()
            em.save(fp='outlined.jpg')
        
            # Print found image borders (tuple)
            print(em.borders)
