        Least-squares fit of a polynomial to data.

        A Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter is a digital filter that can be
        applied to a set of digital data points for the purpose of
        smoothing the data, that is, to increase the signal-to-noise
        ratio without greatly distorting the signal.

        This is achieved, in a process known as convolution,
        by fitting successive sub-sets of adjacent data points with
        a low-degree polynomial by the method of linear least
        squares. When the data points are equally spaced an
        analytical solution to the least-squares equations can be
        found, in the form of a single set of "convolution
        coefficients" that can be applied to all data sub-sets,
        to give estimates of the smoothed signal, (or derivatives of
        the smoothed signal) at the central point of each sub-set.
