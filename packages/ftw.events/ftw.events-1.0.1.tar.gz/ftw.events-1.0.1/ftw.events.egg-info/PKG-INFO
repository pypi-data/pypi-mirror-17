Description: ==============================================================================
        ftw.events
        ==============================================================================
        
        ``ftw.events`` is a Plone add-on allowing you to add containers (event folders)
        containing items representing an event (event page). It is backed by
        ``plone.app.event`` and is powered by ``ftw.simplelayout``.
        
        This Plone add-on is compatible with Plone 4.3.x
        
        
        Installation
        ************
        
        - Add the package to your buildout configuration:
        
        ::
        
            [instance]
            eggs +=
                ...
                ftw.events
        
        - Install the "default" GenericSetup profile.
        
        
        Usage
        *****
        
        Start by creating a container which will hold the events by adding a *event folder*.
        Add as many *event pages* to the event folder as you like.
        
        
        Background
        **********
        
        The name of the content type *event page* has been chosen in order to avoid confusion
        with the content type *event* of Plone.
