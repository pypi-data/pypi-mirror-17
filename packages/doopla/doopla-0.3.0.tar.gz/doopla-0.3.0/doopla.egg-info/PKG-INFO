Description: doopla
        ===============================
        H(ad)oopla!
        A Python script to fetch the output of failed Python Hadoop streaming jobs. It scraps
        the hadoop web interface and gets a random failed mapper and reducer task. It outputs it with
        code highlighting for easy reading.
        
        
            doopla -h
        
            Usage:
            doopla [<jobid>]
            doopla -h | --help
            doopla --version
        
            Options:
            -h --help       Show this screen.
            --version       Show version.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        * Automatically get the last failed job for a user
        * Code highlighting via `Pygments`.
        
        Install
        ------
        Two options for installing:
        
        *Via Pip::*
        
            pip install doopla
        
        *git clone and setup.py*:
        
            git clone git@github.com:trustyou/doopla.git
            cd doopla
            python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        Before using `doopla` please create a file in your home directory called `.doopla` and add
        the follwoing:
        
        
            [main]
            hadoop_version: <HADOOP_VERSION> # either 1 or 2 - defaults to 2
            hadoop_user: <HADOOP_USER>
            hadoop_url: <HADOOP_URL> # For Hadoop 2.x use the Job history URL
            http_user: <USER>
            http_password: <THE_PASSWORD>
        
        Replace `HADOOP_URL` for the HTTP URL of your the Hadoop Web interface. Replace `HADOOP_USER` for your hadoop user (or the one you want to check) and the  `HTTP_PASSWORD` for the http password you normally use to log into the web interface.
        
        The is simple a mather of executing
        
        
            $ doopla
        
        It will search for the most recently failed job and get the output.
        
        Or
        
            $ doopla JOB_ID
        
        If you want to get the output of a specific job.
        
        You can also add `2>/dev/null` if you want to shut down the HTTPS certificate warnings.

        This is a 4 hours hack while skipping lunch and waiting for a job to finish so it is in alpha
        stage and it is full of bugs. So feel free to create pull requests if you see something
        that can be improved.
