        ====
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Url could be constructed from ``str``::
        
           >>> from yarl import URL
           >>> url = URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')
           >>> url
           URL('https://www.python.org/~guido?arg=1#frag')
        
        All url parts: scheme, host, port, path, query and fragment are
        accessible by properties::
        
           >>> url.scheme
           'https'
           >>> url.host
           'www.python.org'
           >>> url.path
           '/~guido'
           >>> url.query_string
           'arg=1'
           >>> url.query
           <MultiDictProxy('arg': '1')>
           >>> url.fragment
           'frag'
        
        All url manipulations produces a new url object::
        
           >>> url.parent / 'downloads/source'
           URL('https://www.python.org/downloads/source')
        
        Strings in ``URL`` object are always unquoted, for getting
        quoted version please convert URL into ``bytes``::
        
           >>> bytes(url)
           b'https://www.python.org/%7Eguido?arg=1#frag'
        
        Constructing URL from bytes performs unquoting as well::
        
           >>> URL(b'https://www.python.org/%7Eguido')
           URL('https://www.python.org/~guido')
