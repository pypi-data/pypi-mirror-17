    """add a knob to disable network tests

    to disable network tests, use PYTEST_USENETWORK=no. by default, it
    is assumed there is network access.

    this is mainly to deal with Debian packages that are built in
    network-less chroots. unfortunately, there is no standard
    environment in dpkg-buildpackage or ./debian/rules binary that we
    can rely on to disable tests, so we revert to a custom variable
    that can hopefully make it up to the pybuild toolchain

    I looked at DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=network, but that is not standard
    and only mentionned once here:

    https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/09/msg00992.html

    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS is also not set by default, so it's not a good
    way to detect Debian package builds

    pbuilder uses USENETWORK=no/yes, schroot uses UNSHARE_NET, but
    those are not standard either, see:

    https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv/issues/77
