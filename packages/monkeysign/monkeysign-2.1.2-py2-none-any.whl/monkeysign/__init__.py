__long_description__ = """
monkeysign is a tool to overhaul the OpenPGP keysigning experience and
bring it closer to something that most primates can understand.

The project makes use of cheap digital cameras and the type of bar
code known as a QRcode to provide a human-friendly yet still-secure
keysigning experience.

No more reciting tedious strings of hexadecimal characters.  And, you
can build a little rogue's gallery of the people that you have met and
exchanged keys with!
