- constructor is passed a client which we'll assume to be thread safe.

- constructor is passed a cache, which satisfies an api to be documented.

  Because protocol is single-threaded, we can update the cache without locks.

  The protocol takes care of cache validation on connect.

- When disconnected, buffer requests and issue them when
  reconnectected.  This would allow brief server restarts without
  causing client errors in many cases.
