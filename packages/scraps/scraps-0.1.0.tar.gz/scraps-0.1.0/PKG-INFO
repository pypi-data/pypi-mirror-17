Description: scraps stands for: SuperConducting Resonator Analysis and Plotting Software
        
        scraps is a project designed to make processing superconducting resonator data as painless as possible.
        
        Documentation is at: http://scraps.readthedocs.io
        
        If you want to write custom code to load in some type of file that is not a modern Agilent PNA, you'll need a custom process_file function.
        
        Short description of files:
        
        resonator.py - Defines the Resonator object
        resonator_sweep.py - Defines the ResonatorSweep object, which is designed to help you when you have so much data.
        plot_tools.py - Helps you make beautiful plots from the data in your Resonator and ResonatorSweep objects
        process_file.py - Get data into pyRes
        fitsS21 - directory containing fit functions for resonator data
        fitsSweep - directory containing fit functions for more complicated things
        resMCMC.py - experimental code for integrating emcee with scraps. No longer used now that lmfit has this implemented directly.
        Example1 - Start here!
        Example2 - Then do this one!
        ExampleData.zip - A ton of actual superconducting resonator data from a Nb microstrip resonator made at ANL
