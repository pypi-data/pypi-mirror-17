Description: LiPD
        ====
        
        Input/output and manipulation utilities for LiPD files in Matlab, R and
        Python.
        
        What is it?
        -----------
        
        LiPD is short for Linked PaleoData. LiPD is the data standard for
        paleoclimatology and the exchange of data amongst paleoclimate experts.
        This package will help you convert your existing database of
        paleoclimate observations into LiPD files. Moreover, it contains tools
        to analyze and manipulate LiPD data.
        
        How does it work?
        -----------------
        
        The LiPD package runs within the Jupyter (formerly iPython) environment.
        Jupyter is an important component for interactive data science and data
        scientific computing. If you are familiar with iPython, then you’ll have
        no problem here. If not, don’t worry, Jupyter is still very easy to
        learn.
        
        LiPD has its own way of manipulating and converting data, but uses
        Jupyter for its structure and interactive computing. When you're working
        you will see Jupyter's interface; however, LiPD will be working in the
        background.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Python v3.4+ is required
        
        LiPD is published through PyPi and easily installed via ``pip``.
        
        ::
        
            pip install LiPD
        
        For more detailed installation instructions, please refer to the file
        called INSTALL.
        
        Quickstart guide
        ----------------
        
        1. Open your command line application (Terminal or Command Prompt):
        
        2. Install with command: ``pip install LiPD``
        
        3. Wait for installation to complete, then type ``lipd`` to launch the
           package.
        
        4. A web portal will launch in your default internet browser.
        
        5. Click to open the ``Welcome LiPD - Quickstart.ipynb`` file.
        
        That’s it!
        
        What you have done is launched the LiPD package and opened your first
        **Notebook**. This specific Notebook is an example and a guide to
        getting you familiar with what LiPD can do, and how to use LiPD
        commands.Once you get the hang of it, you can start creating your own
        Notebooks that are specific to your needs.
