        ## Description
        
        [Kanji Networks](http://www.kanjinetworks.com) was a website offering etymologies for kanjis. The website was closed end of August 2016, but the database was made available as a PDF.
        
        kanjinetworks is an interface for extracting, parsing and exporting the etymologies from the PDF file in python.
        
        The package also include the `kn_to_ja.py` script to import the Kanji Networks etymologies into a [iOS Japanese App](https://japaneseapp.com/) backup files as notes. Warning: existing notes might be lost as this script replaces them.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        kanjinetworks is compatible with Python versions 2 and depends on PDF miner.
        
        ## Install
        
        To install kanjinetworks, run pip:
        
        	pip install kanjinetworks
        	
        or clone this directory and run setup:
        
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Usage
        
        To import etymologies into a Japanese App backup files:
        	
        	kn_to_ja.py PATH_TO_JAPANESE_BACKUP_FILE
        	
        To use the parser:
        
        	from kanjinetworks import get_text
        	from kanjinetworks import KanjiNetworksParser
        	
            text = get_text()
        
            kanjis = KanjiNetworksParser().parse(text)
            for kanji in kanjis:
        		print unicode(kanji)
