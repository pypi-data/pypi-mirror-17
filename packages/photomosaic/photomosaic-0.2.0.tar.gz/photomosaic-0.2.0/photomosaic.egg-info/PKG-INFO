Description: photomosaic
        ===========
        
        Assemble thumbnail-sized images from a large collection into a mosaic which,
        viewed at a distance, gives the impression of one large photo.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        ```python
        import photomosaic as pm
        
        # Load a sample image
        from skimage import data
        img = data.chelsea()  # cat picture!
        
        # Generate dummy images covering the color gamut to use as a pool.
        pm.generate_tile_pool('pool')
        
        # Build the pool (analyze the dummy images).
        pool = pm.make_pool('pool/*.gif')
        
        # Create a mosiac with 15x15 tiles.
        mos = pm.basic_mosaic(img, pool, (15, 15))
        
        # (Optional) Plot the mosaic using matplotlib.
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        plt.imshow(mos)
        
        # Save it.
        from skimage import imsave
        imsave(mos, 'mosaic.png')
        ```

        ---------------
        [John Louis Del Rosario](https://github.com/john2x) also has a [photomosaic project](https://github.com/john2x/photomosaic) in Python. I studied his code while I began writing my own, and there are similarities. However, my algorithm for characterizing tiles and finding matches, which is accomplished mostly through SQL queries, is substatially different.
