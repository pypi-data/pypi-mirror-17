Description: 
        Introduction to the internals of the CheesePi measurement platform.
        
        Install
        -------
        
        To obtain the CheesePi distribution, simply install the python module:
        
        ``$ sudo pip install cheesepi``
        
        This will download and install the modules and programs in your python module
        directory.
        
        
        
        Starting CheesePi
        -----------------
        
        There are three main components, the influxdb server, the measurement
        dispatcher and the dashboard. The influxdb server stores measurement results,
        the dispatcher regularly performs the measurement tasks and stores their
        results in the influxdb. To view the results, the dashboard can optionally be
        started.
        
        Start the storage server:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ``$ cheesepi start storage``
        
        This will try to run the ARM version of influxdb from the CheesePi
        distribution. Alternatively, you can run the system version via its normal
        command.
        
        
        Start measuring
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To start the measurement tasks being dipsatched run the following the command:
        
        ``$ cheesepi start dispatcher``
        
        The tasks specified in the schedule (described below), will be executing
        according to their timing information. The InfluxDB needs to be running in
        order to store the task results.
        
        
        Start the dashboard webserver
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To start the host's webserver running the dashboard use the following command:
        
        ``$ cheesepi start dashboard``
        
        This command starts a webserver on the localhost that will display the
        collected data. Browse to http://HOSTNAME:8080 to view this dashboard.
        
        
        
        Customising behaviour
        ---------------------
        There are two main files for customising the behaviour of CheesePi, a main
        configuration file and a schedule of tasks to execute. The main configuration
        file *cheesepi.conf* controls the level of logging, whether to auto-upgrade the
        code, which central sever to use, etc. The schedule file *schedule.dat*
        specifies which tasks the system will perform. The location of both files from
        your installation can be found with the following command:
        
        ``$ cheesepi status``
        
        Local copies are these files are generated. Any change will stay local to your
        installation and not be overwritten by software upgrades. If you delete your
        local copy, a new default copy will be generated.
        
        Configuration
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        The configuration file format is rather simple, key value pairs of strings are
        set with the format:
        
        *key = value*
        
        Lines can be commented out with a *#*.
        
        
        Schedule
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        The schedule file format is a list of JSON strings (http://www.w3schools.com/json/).
        Each JSON object represents a *measurement task*, the only required 
        field is *taskname*, all others are option parameters to the task. Lines can
        be commented out with a *#*.
        
        
        
        BUGS and problems
        -----------------
        
        
        * If your install fails fails with --single-version-externally-managed* it may
          be caused by problems with python version 2.7.11 To solve try the following:
        
        ``$ sudo conda install python=2.7.10``
