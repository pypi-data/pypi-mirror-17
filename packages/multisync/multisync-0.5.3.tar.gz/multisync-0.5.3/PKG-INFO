Description: MultiSync
        =========
        
        Python script for copying users and groups from a read-only LDAP to several kinds of websites using the Django's ORM.
        
        Currently, synchronization systems are provided for:
        
          * the Django default authentication classes (:class:`django.contrib.auth.models.User` and 
          :class:`django.contrib.auth.models.Group`),
          * the Prosody group system (generates plain config file),
          * the PenatesServer groups and users bases (based on the Django's classes).
        
        You only have to provide a configuration file for the application to synchronize and to run `MultiSync` in a crontab (or manually if you prefer).
        The expeccted LDAP model is currently tied to the one provided by the `Penates <https://github.com/d9pouces/Penates>`,
         but you can easily override it.
        
        
        The default system is extensible and more synchronizers can easily be added.
        More generally, MultiSync relies on a class to synchronize a set of objects against a reference set of objects of same kind,
        and you must implement a few virtual methods for each kind a synchronized website.
