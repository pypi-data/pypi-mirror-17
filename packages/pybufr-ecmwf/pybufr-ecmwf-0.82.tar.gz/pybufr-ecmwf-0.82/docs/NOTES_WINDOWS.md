## No support for windows yet

The pybufr-ecmwf software has not been adapted to any windows version.
The main reason is that the build system of the ECMWF BUFR library (bufrdc) does
not support any windows version.

You could try to install the ECMWF BUFR library in the cygwin or mingw 
environments in windows. If you succeeded doing this, please let me know.
Any reports on your experience here are welcome.

Since ecCodes does support windows, the module will become available
as soon as this ecCodes library is mature and the pybufr-ecmwf
module has been adapted to use it.
If you have an interest in this effort, and can provide any help
on testing or implementation, I would surely appreciate it.
