        Life, the Universe, and Everything
        ==================================
        
        This package defines a Feed Aggregator content type that shows all entries on a list of feeds.
        External content is not indexed in any way.
        
        TODO:
        
        * [ ] deal with shorter timeouts
        * [ ] honor privacy settings on byline
        * [ ] lead image support
        
        Mostly Harmless

        Don't Panic
        ===========
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To enable this package in a buildout-based installation:
        
        #. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                collective.feedaggregator
        
        After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'',
        which will take care of updating your system.
        
        Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.
        
        Check the box next to ``collective.feedaggregator`` and click the 'Activate' button.
        
        How does it work
        ----------------
        
        Every Feed Aggregator includes a list of feeds to be processed.
        The entries in the feeds are parsed in parallel using multiprocessing.
        Results are cached for 15 minutes on an instance base.
        If a Feed Aggregator is modified in any way, caching is invalidated.
        
        Not entirely unlike
        ===================
        
        `Products.feedfeeder <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.feedfeeder>`_
            Archetypes-based folder that turns external feed entries into content items.
            Works in Plone 4.3 and 5.
