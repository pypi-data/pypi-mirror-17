Description: NEON for Python
        ===============

        NEON is very similar to YAML. The main difference is that the NEON supports "entities" (so can be used e.g. to parse phpDoc annotations) and tab characters for indentation. NEON syntax is a little simpler.
        
        Example of Neon code::
        
            # neon example
        
            name: Homer
        
            address:
                street: 742 Evergreen Terrace
                city: Springfield
        
            children:
                + Bart
                + Lisa
                + Maggie
        
            entity: Column(type=integer)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        To install NEON parser for Python, simply run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install neon-py
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Decoding NEON config files is super easy:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import neon
        
            with open('/path/to/config.neon', 'r') as fd:
                config = neon.decode(fd.read())
