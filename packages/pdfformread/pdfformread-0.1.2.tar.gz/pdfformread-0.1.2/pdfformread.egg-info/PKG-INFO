        This Python 2 library and command-line app facilitate
        getting form data from PDF forms, using the PDFMiner
        (http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer) library for
        extraction.  The code is originally from
        http://stackoverflow.com/q/3984003/364875 but with minor
        changes for 2016 and for app.
        
        There are a lot of things that need to be improved here:
        
        * Unicode and other character encoding handling is kludgy at best.
        
        * Only text and selection elements of forms are supported.
        
        * Subforms aren't supported.
