Description: Pyramid REST interface
        ======================
        
        This little package gives shortcuts to create a restful api to database sources. It provides a url pattern to serve the
        sources.
        It is meant to be used in a pyramid web framework eco system. It uses pyramid and sqlalchemy logic as well. Its goal is
        to extend the database usage in pyramid frameworks. This way, it will be possible to serve data sources from
        different databases from a single pyramid application.
        I used a simple class system to make this api as adaptable as possible.
        
        Main features:
        
        * read (json, geojson, xml) + filtering via json parameters - also for geographic attributes
        * read one / show (json, geojson, xml)
        * create one
        * update one
        * delete one
        * data model description (json, geojson, xml) => This provides a description to implement client side forms bound to the underlying data.
        
        Special thing of this api: It can serve geometric extension objects too (It's only limited by geoalchemy2).
        
        Dependencies:
        =============
        * pyramid (tested with 1.7.3)
        * SQLAlchemy (tested with 1.0.15)
        * GeoAlchemy2 (tested with 0.3.0)
        * Shapely (tested with 1.5.17)
        * dicttoxml (tested with 1.7.4)
        * simplejson (tested with 3.8.2)
        
        
        Usage in a standard pyramid web app
        -----------------------------------
        
        The pyramid framework for web apps provides an easy way for including standalone packages in its eco system. To learn
        more about that, please refer to the http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid//en/latest/narr/extending.html.
        
        In a nutshell (inside the __init__.py of your pyramids project in the main method ):
        
        Configure the services which you want to be served via this api. Look at the following example to see how: 
        
        ```python
           from pyramid_georest.lib.rest import Api, Service
           from application.model import TestModel
           def main(global_config, **settings):
              """ This function returns a Pyramid WSGI application."""
              config = Configurator(settings=settings)
              config.include('pyramid_georest', route_prefix='api')
              test_api = Api(
                 'postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/test',
                 config,
                 'test_api'
              )
              test_service = Service(TestModel)
              test_api.add_service(test_service)
              config.scan()
              return config.make_wsgi_app()
        ```
        
        Calling the config.include method with the packages name will do some initializing stuff (Note that the optional
        parameter 'route_prefix' can be used to set the restful interface below a fix name space. This may be helpful especially
        in big applications).
