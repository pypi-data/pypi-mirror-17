"""
A :term:`CPC` (Central Processor Complex) is a physical z Systems or LinuxONE
computer.

A particular HMC can manage multiple CPCs.

The HMC can manage a range of old and new CPC generations. Some older CPC
generations are not capable of supporting the HMC Web Services API; these older
CPCs can be managed using the GUI of the HMC, but not through its Web Services
API. Therefore, such older CPCs will not be exposed at the HMC Web Services
API, and thus will not show up in the API of this Python package.

TODO: List earliest CPC generation that supports the HMC Web Services API.

A CPC can be in any of the following three modes:

- DPM mode: Dynamic Partition Manager is enabled for the CPC.
- Classic mode: The CPC does not have Dynamic Partition Manager enabled,
  and is not member of an ensemble.
- Ensemble mode: The CPC is member of an ensemble. This Python client
  does not support the functionality that is specific to ensemble mode.

The functionality supported at the HMC API and thus also for users of this
Python client, depends on the mode in which the CPC currently is. If a
particular functionality is available only in a specific mode, that is
indicated in the description of the functionality.
