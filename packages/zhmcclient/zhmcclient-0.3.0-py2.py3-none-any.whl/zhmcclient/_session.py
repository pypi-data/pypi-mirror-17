        Perform the HTTP POST method against the resource identified by a URI,
        using a provided request body.

        A set of standard HTTP headers is automatically part of the request.

        HMC operations using HTTP POST are either synchronous or asynchronous.
        Asynchronous operations return the URI of an asynchronously executing
        job that can be queried for status and result.

        Examples for synchronous operations:

        * With no response body: "Logon", "Update CPC Properties"
        * With a response body: "Create Partition"

        Examples for asynchronous operations:

        * With no ``job-results`` field in the completed job status response:
          "Start Partition"
        * With a ``job-results`` field in the completed job status response
          (under certain conditions): "Activate a Blade", or "Set CPC Power
          Save"

        The `wait_for_completion` parameter of this method can be used to deal
        with asynchronous HMC operations in a synchronous way.

        If executing the operation reveals that the HMC session token is
        expired, this method re-logs on and retries the operation.

        Parameters:

          uri (:term:`string`):
            Relative URI path of the resource, e.g. "/api/session".
            This URI is relative to the base URL of the session (see the
            :attr:`~zhmcclient.Session.base_url` property).
            Must not be `None`.

          body (:term:`json object`):
            JSON object to be used as the HTTP request body (payload).
            `None` means the same as an empty dictionary, namely that no HTTP
            body is included in the request.

          logon_required (bool):
            Boolean indicating whether the operation requires that the session
            is logged on to the HMC. For example, the "Logon" operation does
            not require that.

          wait_for_completion (bool):
            Boolean controlling whether this method should wait for completion
            of the requested HMC operation, as follows:

            * If `True`, this method will wait for completion of the requested
              operation, regardless of whether the operation is synchronous or
              asynchronous.

            * If `False`, this method will immediately return the result of the
              HTTP POST method, regardless of whether the operation is
              synchronous or asynchronous.

        Returns:

          :term:`json object`:

            If `wait_for_completion` is `True`, returns a JSON object
            representing the response body of the synchronous operation, or the
            response body of the completed job that performed the asynchronous
            operation. If a synchronous operation has no response body, `None`
            is returned.

            If `wait_for_completion` is `False`, returns a JSON object
            representing the response body of the synchronous or asynchronous
            operation. In case of an asynchronous operation, the JSON object
            will have a member named ``job-uri``, whose value can be used with
            the :meth:`~zhmcclient.Session.query_job_status` method to
            determine the status of the job and the result of the original
            operation, once the job has completed.

            See the section in the :term:`HMC API` about the specific HMC
            operation and about the "Query Job Status" operation, for a
            description of the members of the returned JSON objects.

            This URI is relative to the base URL of the session (see

          logon_required (bool):

            is logged on to the HMC. For example, for the logoff operation, it
            does not make sense to first log on.

        Perform the "Query Job Status" operation on a job identified by its
        URI and return the status of the job. If the job is complete, the
        return value also contains the result of the operation the job was
        performing asynchronously.

        A set of standard HTTP headers is automatically part of the request.

        If the HMC session token is expired, this method re-logs on and retries
        the operation.

        Parameters:

          job_uri (:term:`string`):
            Job URI; e.g. from the value of the ``job-uri`` field of the
            result of the original operation that was performed asynchronously
            by the job.
            Must not be `None`.

        Returns:

          :term:`json object`:

            A JSON object indicating the status of the job in its ``status``
            member, and if the job is complete (``status='complete'``), also
            with members ``job-status-code``, ``job-reason-code``, and
            optionally ``job-results``.

            "Query Job Status" operation and about the original operation that
            was performed asynchronously.
