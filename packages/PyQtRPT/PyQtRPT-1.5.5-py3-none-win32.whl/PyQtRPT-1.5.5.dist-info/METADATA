QtRPT is the easy-to-use print report engine written in C++ QtToolkit. 
It allows combining several reports in one XML file. For separately taken field, 
you can specify some condition depending on which this field will display in different font and background color, etc.
The project consists of two parts: report library QtRPT and report designer application QtRptDesigner. Report file is a file in XML format. 
The report designer makes easy to create report XML file. 
Thanks to Qt library, our project can be used in programs for work in the operating systems Windows, Linux, MacOS

License:

For a long time the QtRPT project is distributed under the LGPL license. This license allows you to dynamically 
link with your source code. In order to facilitate the user to use QtRPT and allow to produce statically linking, 
I decided to change the Apache 2.0 license.
License Apache 2.0 more permissive compared to LGPL, I hope that the transition will not create problems for you.
Please note that QtRPT to generate bar code uses the Zint library, which is distributed under license GPL, 
in this case, you must use your project is also under this license or disable the use of the Zint library.
