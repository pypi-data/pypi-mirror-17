0.1.5
 - Code cleanup
0.1.4
 - Padding is now available in all methods (#2)
 - Added new convenient submodule `pad`
 - Bugfix: autofocusing did not return the correct focusing distance.
   This resulted in a slight offset in the refocusing distance for
   the method `autofocus_stack` when `same_dist=True` was set.
 - New test functions for `pad`
