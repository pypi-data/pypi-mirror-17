Description: # vcfped
        VCFped is a command line utility which quickly and confidently identifies close relationships (e.g. parent-child, trios and quartets) in a multisample VCF file.
        The algorithm does not rely on allele frequencies or other annotations, and is highly robust to inbreeding and poor quality variants.
