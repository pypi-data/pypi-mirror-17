=========================
Client server interaction
=========================

In most cases, the client sends a request to the server when  following methods 
of an element are executed:

* :doc:`open </refs/client/item/m_open>`
* :doc:`apply </refs/client/item/m_apply>`
* :doc:`server </refs/client/abstr_item/m_server>`

In this case the client sends to the server the 
:doc:`ID </refs/client/abstr_item/at_id>`
of the item's task, the
:doc:`ID </refs/client/abstr_item/at_id>`
item, the type of the request and its parameters.

The server on receiving the request, based on passed IDs, finds the task 
(it can be Project task or Administrator task) and the item on the server, 
executes the corresponing method with passed parameters and returns the result of
the execution to the client.
