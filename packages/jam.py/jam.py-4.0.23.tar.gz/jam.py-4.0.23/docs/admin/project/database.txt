In this dialog project database pararameters are displayed. When they have been 
changed and OK button is clicked, the Administrator will check connection to the 
database and if it failed to connect the error will be displayed.

.. note::
   When **Database** parameter is changed, *server.py* must be restarted 
   for changes to take effect.


If **DB manual update** checkbox is unchecked (default), then when changes to an 
item, that have an associated database table, are saved, this database table is 
automatically modified. For example, if we add a new field to some catalog in the 
project, the new field will be create if the database table associated with this
catalog as well. If this checkbox is checked, no modifications to the database 
tables are made. 

.. note::
    Please be very carefull when using this option.
