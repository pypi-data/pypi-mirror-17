Usage:
======
This example shows how to use pylocker in the most general way. We won't be locking 
a file but aquiring a lock and testing if for doing whatever we want.


.. code-block:: python
    
        import uuid
        from pylocker import Locker
        
        #  create a unique lock pass. This can be any string.
        lpass = str(uuid.uuid1())
        
        # create locker instance.
        FL = Locker(filePath=None, lockPass=lpass)
        
        # try to aquire the lock
        aquired, code = FL.acquire_lock()
        
        # check if aquired.
        if aquired:
            print "Lock aquired"
            print "In this if statement block I can do whatever I want before releasing the lock"
        else:
            print "Unable to aquire the lock. exit code %s"%code
            print "keep this block empty as the lock was not acquired"
        
        # now release the lock.
        FL.release_lock()



The above example can also be done using 'with' statement


.. code-block:: python

        import uuid
        from pylocker import Locker
        
        #  create a unique lock pass. This can be any string.
        lpass = str(uuid.uuid1())
        
        # create locker instance
        FL = Locker(filePath=None, lockPass=lpass)
        
        # aquire the lock
        with FL as r:
            # r is a tuple of three items. the aquired result, the aquiring code and 
            # a file descriptor fd. fd will always be None when filePath is None.  
            # Otherwise fd can be a real opened file descriptor when acquired is 
            # True. In this particular case fd is always None regardless whether 
            # the lock was successfully aquired or not because filePath is None.
            acquired, code, fd  = r
            
             
            # check if aquired.
            if acquired:
                print "Lock aquired, in this if statement do whatever you want"
            else:
                print "Unable to aquire the lock. exit code %s"%code
        
        # no need to release anything because with statement takes care of that.
        

Now let's lock a file using 'with' statement


.. code-block:: python

        import uuid
        from pylocker import Locker
        
        #  create a unique lock pass. This can be any string.
        lpass = str(uuid.uuid1())
        
        # create locker instance.
        FL = Locker(filePath='myfile.txt', lockPass=lpass, mode='w')
        
        # aquire the lock
        with FL as r:
            # get the result
            acquired, code, fd  = r
            
            # check if aquired.
            if fd is not None:
                print fd
                fd.write("I have succesfuly aquired the lock !")
        
        # no need to release anything or to close the file descriptor, 
        # with statement takes care of that. let's print fd and verify that.
        print fd

    """
    This is pylocker main class. Locker can be used for general locking purposes and 
    more specifically to lock a file from reading or writing to whoever that doesn't  
    have the lock pass.
    
    :Parameters:
        #. filePath (None, path): The file that needs to be locked. When given and a lock 
           is aquired, the file will be automatically opened for writing or reading 
           depending on the given mode. If None is given, the locker can always be used
           for its general purpose as shown in the examples.
        #. lockPass (string): The locking pass.
        #. mode (string): This is file opening mode and it can be any of 
           'r','r+','w','w+','a','a+'. If filePath is None, this argument will not be
           discarded.
        #. lockPath (None, path): The locking file path. If None is given the locking file
           will be automatically created to '.lock' in the filePath directory. If 
           filePath is None, '.lock' will be created in the current working directory.
        #. timeout (number): The maximum delay or time allowed to successfully set the 
           lock. When timeout is exhausted before successfully setting the lock, 
           the lock ends up not acquired.
        #. wait (number): The time delay between each attempt to lock. By default it's
           set to 0 to keeping the aquiring mechanism trying to aquire the lock without 
           losing any time waiting. Setting wait to a higher value suchs as 0.05 seconds
           or higher can be very useful in special cases when many processes are trying 
           to acquire the lock and one of them needs to hold it a release it at a higher
           frequency or rate.
        #. deadLock (number): The time delay judging if the lock was left out mistakenly 
           after a system crash or other unexpected reasons. Normally Locker is stable 
           and takes care of not leaving any locking file hanging even it crashes or it
           is forced to stop by a user signal.
