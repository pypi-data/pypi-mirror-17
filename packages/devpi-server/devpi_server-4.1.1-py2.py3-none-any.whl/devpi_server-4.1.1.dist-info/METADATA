devpi-server: pypi server for caching and private indexes

consistent robust pypi-cache
----------------------------------------

You can point ``pip or easy_install`` to the ``root/pypi/+simple/``
index, serving as a self-updating transparent cache for pypi-hosted
**and** external packages.  Cache-invalidation uses the latest and
greatest PyPI protocols.  The cache index continues to serve when
offline and will resume cache-updates once network is available.

user specific indexes
---------------------

Each user (which can represent a person or a project, team) can have
multiple indexes and upload packages and docs via standard ``setup.py``
invocations command.  Users and indexes can be manipulated through a
RESTful HTTP API.

index inheritance
--------------------------

Each index can be configured to merge in other indexes so that it serves
both its uploads and all releases from other index(es).  For example, an
index using ``root/pypi`` as a parent is a good place to test out a
release candidate before you push it to PyPI.

good defaults and easy deployment
---------------------------------------

Get started easily and create a permanent devpi-server deployment
including pre-configured templates for ``nginx`` and cron. 

separate tool for Packaging/Testing activities
-------------------------------------------------------

The complimentary `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/devpi-client>`_ tool
helps to manage users, indexes, logins and typical setup.py-based upload and
installation workflows.

See http://doc.devpi.net for getting started and documentation.



Changelog
=========

4.1.1 (2016-10-14)
------------------

- when a project has no releases (only setup.py register ran) and it isn't
  whitelisted, then upstream releases will now be blocked as expected.

- Adjust event processing status messages and the times when they are shown:
  After 5 minutes of no event processing there will be a warning.
  After 30 minutes this will turn into a fatal status.
  After 1 hour of not being in sync there will be a warning.
  After 6 hours of desync the status turns fatal.

- handle sqlite3.NotSupportedError when the installed sqlite doesn't support
  URI filenames at all.


4.1.0 (2016-07-15)
------------------

- Try opening read only transactions in SQLite read only mode for better
  concurrency/locking behaviour. This is officially supported with Python 3.4,
  but many systems allow it implicitly in older Python versions.

- fix issue353: If an index inherits from a mirror with an empty cache and the
  mirror is returning errors, there would be an error returned by devpi. Now
  this situation is treated like the mirror has no releases and just the
  releases from the index are returned.

- fix issue352: When there was an issue during commit or rollback, the thread
  local info got into an inconsistent state. This caused an AttributeError
  whenever that thread was used. Eventually this could exhaust all worker
  threads and make devpi unresponsive.

- fix issue354: allow more general agent versions, such as 'Python-urllib/3.5'
  to appear before the installer user agent string so redirects for setuptools
  versions which had that work.

- fix issue214: change the order in which indices are searched to fix the
  mirror whitelisting and also make sure that packages, if available,
  are always installed from internal indices instead of root/pypi.


4.0.0 (2016-05-12)
------------------

.. note::

  Please note that devpi-server 4.0.0 is a bug fix/compatibility release as it
  only changes project name normalization compared to 3.1.x. The internal use
  of the normalization requires an export/import cycle, which is the reason for
  the major version increase. There are no other big changes and so everyone
  who used devpi-server 3.x.y should be fine just using 4.0.0. It's also fine
  to export from 2.6.x and import with 4.0.0.

- require devpi-common 3.0.0 which changes the normalization of project names.

- allow import of exported data from devpi-server 3.1.2 with inconsistently
  normalized project names.


3.1.2 (2016-05-12)
------------------

- fix issue336: the mirror_whitelist setting got lost on import.

- allow export if a package with dotted name was uploaded while
  devpi-common 2.0.9 was installed. The resulting export will only be
  importable with devpi-server 4.x. It will fail to import in 3.x with a
  MissingRegistration error.


3.1.1 (2016-05-11)
------------------

- fix import of releases for packages with dots in their name after PEP-503
  fix in devpi-common 2.0.9.
