Solgema.EnvironmentViewlets Package Readme
==========================================

Overview
--------

This package defines new viewlets for portal logo, banner, footer, print logo and print footer.
You can use any plone content to be displayed in those viewlets.
Viewlet contents are searched through the path so they are contextual. For example you can define your banners or logo for a single folder only.

To add a content in an environment viewlet, just go on the content, click on the Evironment tab and choose where you want to use the content.

The banner has its own carousel display.
