        Ever did a mistake to ``pip install`` in the terminal when installing
        packages from ``requirements.txt`` file like following?
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install requirements.txt
            Collecting requirements.txt
              Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement requirements.txt (from versions: )
            No matching distribution found for requirements.txt
        
        Now you wont. Thanks to some nasty hacks and tricks there is a package
        on PyPI that handles that. It finds the desired requirements file and
        installs it in your current environment.
        
        ::
        
            echo "gevent" > requirements-dev.txt
            pip install requirements-dev.txt
        
        This package was made only for trolling so do not expect it to work. It
        may work on Linux and Mac OS X but was not extensively tested. It is
        also a one-shot trick so no updates will be installed once you do that
        unless you specify a ``-U`` or ``--update`` switch. Happy debugging!
        
        PyPI (fortunately) does not allow to upload package named
        ``requirements.txt`` so the only supported name is currently a
        ``requirements-dev.txt``. It still should be quite popular though.
