"""
This module hides the source of implementation of weak method. WeakMethod is provided in pypubsub 4.0+ by either
standard lib (Python >= 3.4) or weakrefmethod (Python < 3.4). Prior to pypubsub 4.0, WeakMethod was a custom
class that adhered to the WeakRef API. Note that methods cannot be given to weakref.WeakRef because methods
cannot be referenced, only a temporary "instance method" created for each reference can be used. This would cause
WeakRef(method) to be "dead on creation".

Use the getWeakRef(object) module function to create the
proper type of weak reference (weakref.WeakRef or WeakMethod) for given object.
