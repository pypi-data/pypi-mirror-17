ReproZip
========

`ReproZip <https://vida-nyu.github.io/reprozip/>`__ is a tool aimed at simplifying the process of creating reproducible
experiments from command-line executions, a frequently-used common denominator
in computational science. It tracks operating system calls and creates a package
that contains all the binaries, files and dependencies required to run a given
command on the author's computational environment (packing step).
A reviewer can then extract the experiment in his environment to reproduce the results (unpacking step).

reprounzip-vistrails
--------------------

This is a plugin that creates VisTrails workflows from unpacked experiments. See the `VisTrails website <https://www.vistrails.org/>`_ for more information about VisTrails.
