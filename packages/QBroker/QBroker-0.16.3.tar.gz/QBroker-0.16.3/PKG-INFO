Description: QBroker is short for Quick Access Broker.
        
        QBroker is a minimal wrapper for asynchronous, debuggable RPC via AMQP.
        It uses Python 3.4 asyncio features and provides wrappers for use with
        native threads or gevent tasks.
        
        Example scripts, including a monitor which can watch RPC calls and replies,
        are provided.
        
        QBroker is written in Python. If you know JSON and AMQP, writing a server
        or client in a different language is reasonably straightforward.
