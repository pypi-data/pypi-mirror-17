    Arguments:
        log(logger obj): A logger to log messages.

        config(configparger obj): A configparser object with the configuration

        bird_conf_file('str'): The absolute path of file which contains the

        which routes are allowed to be advertised

        bird_constant_name('str'): The constant name used in the BIRD daemon
        configuration.

        dummy_prefix('str'): A dummy IP prefix which must be always present
        in bird_constant_name and it should never be removed from it.

        action(Queue obj): A queue of IP prefixes and their action to be taken
        based on the state of health check. An item is a tuple of 3 elements:
            1st: name of the thread.
            2nd: IP prefix.
            3nd: Action to take, either 'add' or 'del'.

    Methods:
        run(): Lunches checks and updates BIRD configuration based on
        the result of the check.
