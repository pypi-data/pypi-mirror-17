PyAlarm Device Server
---------------------

panic.ds.PyAlarm Device Class

PyAlarm is the alarm device server used by ALBA Alarm System, it requires PyTango and Fandango modules, 
both available from tango-cs.sourceforge.net

Some configuration panels in the GUI require PyAlarm to be available in the PYTHONPATH, to do so you can 
add the PyAlarm.py folder to the PYTHONPATH variable or copy the PyAlarm.py file within the panic folder; 
so it could be loaded as a part of the module.


Panic GUI
---------

panic.gui.AlarmGUI Class

Panic is an application for controlling and managing alarms. It depends on panic and taurus libraries.

It allows the user to visualize existing alarms in a clear form and adding/editing/deleting alarms.
In edit mode user can change name, move alarms to another device, change descriptions and modify formulas.
Additional widgets in which the app is equipped allows alarm history viewing, phonebook editing and 
device settings manipulation.
