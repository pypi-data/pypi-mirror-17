	"""A Bayesian Network Model.

	A Bayesian network is a directed graph where nodes represent variables, edges
	represent conditional dependencies of the children on their parents, and the
	lack of an edge represents a conditional independence. 

	Parameters
	----------
	name : str, optional
		The name of the model. Default is None

	Attributes
	----------
	states : list, shape (n_states,)
		A list of all the state objects in the model

	graph : networkx.DiGraph
		The underlying graph object.

	Example
