        localmin (numpy.ndarray): 1-D ndarray for which to find local
            minima.  Should have a numeric dtype.

    Returns:

        element are always False.

def limit_ndarray(M, limits):

    This function filters a structured ndarray based on ranges defined for
    zero or more fields.  For each field f with limits (lo, hi), it will
    select only those elements where lo<=X[f]<hi.

    >>> X = array([(2, 3), (4, 5), (8, 2), (5, 1)],

    Arguments:

        limits (dict): Dictionary with limits.  Keys must correspond to
            fields in M.  If this is a scalar field
            (`M.dtype[field].shape==()`), values are tuples (lo, hi).
            If this is a multidimensional field, values are tuples (lo,
            hi, mode), where mode must be either `all` or `any`.
            Values in the range [lo, hi) are retained, applying all or any
