0. Description
--------------------
A python package for image processing and scientific analysis of imaging modalities such as multi-frequency scanning probe microscopy,
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
Classes implemented here are ported to a high performance computing platform at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).

1. Package Structure
-----------------
The package structure is simple, with 4 main modules:
   1. `io`: Input/Output from custom & proprietary microscope formats to HDF5.
   2. `processing`: Multivariate Statistics, Machine Learning, and Filtering.
   3. `analysis`: Model-dependent analysis of image information.
   4. `viz`: Visualization and interactive slicing of high-dimensional data by lightweight Qt viewers.

Once a user converts their microscope's data format into an HDF5 format, by simply extending some of the classes in `io`, the user gains access to the rest of the utilities present in `pycroscopy.*`.
