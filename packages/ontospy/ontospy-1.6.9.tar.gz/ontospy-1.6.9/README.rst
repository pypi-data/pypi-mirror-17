OntoSpy
=======================

RDFLIb-based Python toolkit for inspecting ontologies on the Semantic Web.


Description
------------

OntoSpy is a lightweight Python library and command line tool for inspecting and navigating vocabularies encoded using W3C Semantic Web standards (aka ontologies). 

The basic workflow is simple: load a graph by instantiating the ``Graph`` class with a file containing RDFS, OWL or SKOS definitions. You get back an object that lets you interrogate the ontology. That's all!

The same functionalities are accessible also via a handy command line application. This consists of an interactive environment (`ontospy --shell`) that allows to save ontologies into a local repository so that they can be quickly reloaded for inspection later on.
