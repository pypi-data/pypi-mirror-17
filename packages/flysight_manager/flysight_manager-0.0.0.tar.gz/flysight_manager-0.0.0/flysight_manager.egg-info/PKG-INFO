Description: flysight-manager
        ================
        
        A tool for uploading flysight data directly to ðŸ†ƒðŸ…·ðŸ…´ ðŸ…²ðŸ…»ðŸ…¾ðŸ†„ðŸ…³
        
        At it's simplest:
        
        * Get a dropbox token. Put it in .flysight-token
        * Configure your mounter (see below)
        * edit `config.ini.example` and save as `config.ini`
        * Configure your system to allow whichever user you'll run this as to `sudo
          umount $mountpoint` without a password.
        * Test run without arguments
        * Arrange to run it with `--daemon`
        
        
        # Mounting
        
        On OSX it should be sufficient to merely tell it to look for `/Volumes/NO NAME` (or rename your flysight).
        
        On linux you probably want to do some uuid-fstab-neckbeard shenanigans.
