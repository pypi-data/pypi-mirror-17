        Concurrently
        ============
        
        Library helps easy write concurrent executed code blocks.
        
        Quick example::
        
            import asyncio
            from concurrently import concurrently
        
        
            async def amain(loop):
                """
                How to fetch some web pages with concurrently.
                """
                urls = [  # define pages urls
                    'http://test/page_1',
                    'http://test/page_2',
                    'http://test/page_3',
                    'http://test/page_4',
                ]
                results = {}
        
                # immediately run wrapped function concurrent
                # in 2 thread (asyncio coroutines)
                @concurrently(2)
                async def fetch_urls():
                    for url in urls:
                        page = await fetch_page(url)  # some function for download page
                        results[url] = page
        
                # wait until all concurrent threads finished
                await fetch_urls()
                print(results)
        
        
            if __name__ == '__main__':
                loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
                loop.run_until_complete(amain(loop))
        
        
        ``Concurrently`` supports specific different concurrent engines.
        
        Engines
        =======
        
        AsyncIOEngine
        -------------
        
        Default engine for concurrently run code as asyncio coroutines::
        
            from concurrently import concurrently, AsyncIOEngine
        
            ...
            @concurrently(2, engine=AsyncIOEngine, loop=loop)  # loop is option
            async def fetch_urls():
                ...
        
            await fetch_urls()
        
        
        AsyncIOThreadEngine
        -------------------
        
        Concurrently run code in threads with asyncio::
        
            from concurrently import concurrently, AsyncIOThreadEngine
        
            ...
            @concurrently(2, engine=AsyncIOThreadEngine, loop=loop)
            def fetch_urls():  # not async def
                ...
        
            await fetch_urls()
        
        
        ThreadEngine
        ------------
        
        Concurrently run code in system threads::
        
            from concurrently import concurrently, ThreadEngine
        
            ...
            @concurrently(2, engine=ThreadEngine)
            def fetch_urls():  # not async def
                ...
        
            fetch_urls()  # not await
        
        
        ProcessEngine
        -------------
        
        Concurrently run code in system process::
        
            from concurrently import concurrently, ProcessEngine
        
            ...
            @concurrently(2, engine=ProcessEngine)
            def fetch_urls():
                ...
        
            fetch_urls()
        
        
        GeventEngine
        -------------
        
        Concurrently run code as gevent greenlet::
        
            from concurrently import concurrently, GeventEngine
        
            ...
            @concurrently(2, engine=GeventEngine)
            def fetch_urls():
                ...
        
            fetch_urls()
