Description: 
        The provided server implementation for CoilMQ uses the Python SocketServer
        libraries; however, CoilMQ is only loosely coupled to this server
        implementation.  It could be used with other socket implementations.
        
        The CoilMQ core classes and bundled storage implementations are built to be
        thread-safe.
