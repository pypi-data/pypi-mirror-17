> Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.

Enhance the genstrings command by adding merging capabilities  
Documentation is available at [https://igenstrings.readthedocs.org][docs].

## Features

* Ensure your files are encoded in UTF-8 (as [recommended by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/Strings/Strings.html) now)
* Takes care of runing the genstrings command on all files `\*.m`, `\*.mm` and `\*.swift`
* Merge the results with previous version of the Localizable.string files you may have
* Inform you if it works correctly

## Installation

```sh
$ pip install igenstrings
```

## Requirements

Ensure your `*.strings` files are UTF-8 encoded as [Apple recommends it](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/Strings/Strings.html) now :

> It is recommended that you save strings files using the UTF-8 encoding, which is the default encoding for standard strings files. Xcode automatically transcodes strings files from UTF-8 to UTF-16 when theyâ€™re copied into the product.

## Usage

```sh
$ igenstrings ./MyXcodeProjectDir
```

*output*

```sh
Running the script on path ./MyXcodeProjectDir
Excluded path regex: None
languages found : ['./MyXcodeProjectDir/en.lproj', './MyXcodeProjectDir/fr.lproj']
Job done for language: ./MyXcodeProjectDir/en.lproj
Job done for language: ./MyXcodeProjectDir/fr.lproj
```

## Known Issues

* The Apple `genstrings` command doesn't like path that contains spaces.
  So avoid subfolders containing spaces, otherwise the Localizable.string will not be complete
* You need to respect the format used by the genstrings command unless it will breaks.
  So, to avoid issues use strictly the format below for each translated text.
  Also do not remove the line break between two fields or it will breaks too.

```ruby
/* Comment for localizable string */
"Your string" = "Translated string";

/* Comment for localizable string */
"Your string #2" = "Translated string #2";
```
