        `plone.formwidget.multifile` is a z3c.form-widget which lets users
        upload multiple files, either at once, or in batches using repeated form
        submissions.
        
        Browsers that do not implement the file input "multiple" attribute are
        supported via javascript adding of multiple file inputs. This also works
        with browsers that do support "multiple", and allows users to add and
        remove files in bundles. Upload does not occur until the form is saved.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Using the widget is quite easy::
        
            >>> from plone.directives import form as directivesform
            >>> from plone.formwidget.multifile import MultiFileFieldWidget
            >>> from plone.namedfile.field import NamedFile
            >>> from zope import schema
            >>> from zope.interface import Interface
            >>>
            >>> class IMySchema(Interface):
            ...     """My schema interface"""
            ...
            ...     directivesform.widget(files=MultiFileFieldWidget)
            ...     files = schema.List(title=u'Files',
            ...                         value_type=NamedFile())
        
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        We do not yet support ordering.
        There is no fallback for non-html5, non-javascript browsers. They will
        only be able to upload 1 file at a time.
        
        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.0 (2016-08-31)
        ----------------
        
        Incompatibilities:
        
        - Instead of ``zope.app.file.interfaces.IFile`` use ``plone.namedfile.interfaces.IFile``.
          [thet]
        
        - Fix missing Javascript call that breaks the widget
          [laulaz]
        
        - Add French and Dutch translations
          [laulaz]
        
        - Add travis & coveralls hook
          [tomgross]
        
        - Plone 5.0 support
          [tomgross]
        
        1.1 (2014-03-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Added Spanish (es) and Basque (eu) translation
          [erral]
        
        - Added PO file generation script
          [erral]
        
        - Use similar pattern to plone.formwidget.namedfile for the data converter.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Add @@download BrowserView for file downloads
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Base widget on z3c.form.widget.Widget instead of MultiWidget. The MultiWidget
          is for combining different widgets into one.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Don't call update from render. This is not necessary and can lead to unwanted
          side-effects.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Extract FileUpload objects instead of relying on Widget.extract to do the mostly
          right thing.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Base files shown by the widget on the actual fields content instead of a mixture
          of request data and converter magic.
          [gaudenz]
        
        - Improve input template and JavaScript
        
          - Append file inputs below the file list to not overwrite existing files
          - Remove Hacks for IE7. They no longer work with recent jQuery versions and
            IE7 is mostly irrelevant by now.
          - Use standard file input widget instead of custom add link. This is what people
            expect and as a bonus is already translated. If people want custom links they can
            still override the template.
        
          - Integrate not yet uploaded files into the same file list.
            [gaudenz]
        
        - Add german translation
          [gaudenz]
        
        1.0a6 (2013-01-22)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed bug: "add files" link was opening multiple file dialogs.
          [rafaelbco]
        * Fixed bug: bugfix of the previous release didn't work on IE 7.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a5 (2013-01-21)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed bug on IE: When an file-input is opened via a scripted, forced click()
          event, IE won't let you submit the form.
          [rafaelbco]
        * Updated pt_BR translation.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a4 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Updated URL on setup.py
          [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a3 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Changed the UI so now there's a link to "add files" instead of an standard
          input[type=file] HTML element (which still exists, but is hidden). Users were
          complaining that the old UI was confusing since the textbox of the
          input[type=file] element was always empty.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a2 (2012-12-20)
        ------------------
        
        * Removed integration with jQuery plugin. Instead we use HTML and javascript,
          and when applicable, the "multiple" extension from HTML5 which lets a
          user upload multiple files at once.
          [tmog]
        
        * Fix minor bugs on the new non-flash implementation.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        * Removed dependency on plone.app.drafts.
          [rafaelbco]
        
        1.0a1 (2011-09-13)
        ------------------
        
        * Initial release
