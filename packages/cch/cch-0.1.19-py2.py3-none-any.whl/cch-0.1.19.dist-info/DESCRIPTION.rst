CCH - Cloud CLI for Humans.

Very simple cloud CLI, specifically designed for human use. Strictly forbidden
for scripts' consumption :)

Just type `mkvm` and it will help you step-by-step create a virtual machine, by
first letting you provide a flavor from availale flavors, then similarly a
security group, and then root volume storage.  All the other commands are just
as simple!
