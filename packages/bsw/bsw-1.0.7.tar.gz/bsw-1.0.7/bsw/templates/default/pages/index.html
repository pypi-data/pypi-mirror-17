    <a href="https://github.com/davb5/bsw">bsw</a>, Build Static Web,
    is an easy to use, simple static website generator.
</p>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
    Get started by editing your site content in the <em>pages</em>
    folder. We've pre-generated this page (index.html), an "about"
    page (about/index.html) and a sample blog post.
</p>
<p>
    Once you've put some content together, try editing the site
    templates in the <em>templates</em> folder. There are a couple
    of samples included - base.html (which was used to render this
    page) and blog.html (which was used for the sample blog post).
    The CSS for the templates is in the templates/static/main.css
    file.
</p>
<h2>Static files</h2>
<p>
    Static files live in two places - the <em>static</em> folder and
    the <em>templates/static</em> folder. The top level static folder
    is for page related static images (for example, blog post photos
    or binary files you make available for download). The templates
    static folder is for site-wide static files (such as your site
    logo and stylesheets). Both groups of static files get combined
    into a single <em>build/static</em> folder at the build stage.
