    This is a sample blog post. It's a great example of a few of bsw's
    most powerful features:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multiple templates (a specific "blog" template)</li>
    <li>Templating with page vars</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It's actually just like any other page - bsw doesn't have any
    blog specific functionality. However by using the simple templating
    system you can easily create custom page types.

    Check out the page markup in pages/blog/... and have a look at the
    template in templates/blog.html to see how easy it is to work with.
