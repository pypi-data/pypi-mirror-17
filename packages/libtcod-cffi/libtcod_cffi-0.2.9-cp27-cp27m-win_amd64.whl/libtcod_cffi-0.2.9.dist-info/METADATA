=======
 About
=======
This is a Python CFFI port of libtcod, this is an offshoot of the python-tdl project and has been made into it's own package.
Both projects are still developed together, and this module provides functions specifically to be used by python-tdl.

This library is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/HexDecimal/libtcod-cffi

Any issues you have with this module can be reported at the GitHub issue tracker: https://github.com/HexDecimal/libtcod-cffi/issues

python-tdl is a port of libtcod made to be "Pythonic", you can find it here: https://github.com/HexDecimal/python-tdl

And libtcod is here: http://roguecentral.org/doryen/libtcod/

==============
 Installation
==============
The latest Windows installer can be found on PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libtcod-cffi

You might get errors during the installation of libtcod-cffi such as
"ImportError: No module named 'cffi.setuptools_ext'"
This will happen if your cffi module is out of date.

The recommended way to install is by using pip, but be sure to update your cffi
module first.  Use the following commands::

    pip install -U cffi
    pip install libtcod-cffi

This module can also be manually installed, make sure Python modules
"setuptools" and "cffi" are up to date.
Then go into the "setup.py" directory and running the command::

    python setup.py install

A manual install requires that your Python environment is set up to compile binaries.

=======
 Usage
=======
This module was designed to be backwards compatible with the libtcod.py script that was distributed with libtcod.
If you had code that runs on the original module you can use this library as a drop-in replacement like this::

    import tcod as libtcod

Guides and Tutorials for the original library should also work with this one.
When possible, using PyPy will give the best performance, and is highly reccomended.
