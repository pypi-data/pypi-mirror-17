Description: edxcut
        ======
        
        edxcut = edX Course Unit Tests
        
        This is an open source package for performing unit tests of answer box
        grading correctness, for a live running open edX course instance.
        
        edxcut accepts a course unit test specification file (in YAML format),
        and interacts with the edX course instance, mimicing a live learner,
        via direct calls to the edX xblock APIs for problem checking and the
        instructor dashboard, for resetting problem attempts.  Test cases
        specify inputs, and whether the expected graded return should be
        correct or incorrect, for each case.
        
        The course unit tests file can be produced manually, or by digesting
        the course XML, or automatically, during compilation using
        [latex2edx](https://github.com/mitocw/latex2edx).  When using
        latex2edx, you can specify multiple test cases within the `\edXabox`
        macro, including both expected correct and incorrect cases.
        
        Example tests file
        ------------------
        
        Below is an [example tests YAML file](https://github.com/mitodl/edxcut/blob/master/test_data/test_demo_course.yaml)
        which can be run to test some problems in the demo course provided with the [edX fullstack](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OpenOPS/Running+Fullstack) (dogwood release) virtualbox VM:
        
        ```YAML
        config:
          course_id: course-v1:edX+DemoX+Demo_Course
          site_base_url: http://192.168.33.10
          username: staff@example.com
          password: edx
        
        tests:
          - url_name: 75f9562c77bc4858b61f907bb810d974
            responses: [ 43.141, 4500, 5 ]
            expected: [incorrect, correct, correct]
          - url_name: 75f9562c77bc4858b61f907bb810d974
            responses: [ 43.141, 4500, 9 ]
            expected: [incorrect, correct, incorrect]
          - url_name: 75f9562c77bc4858b61f907bb810d974
            responses: [ 43.141, 4500, 9 ]
            expected: incorrect
          - url_name: Sample_Algebraic_Problem
            responses: [A*x^2 + sqrt(y)]
            expected: correct
          - url_name: Sample_ChemFormula_Problem
            responses: [H2SO4  -> H^+ + 2 HSO4^-]
            expected: incorrect
          - url_name: Sample_ChemFormula_Problem
            responses: [H2SO4  -> H^+ + HSO4^-]
            expected: correct
        ```
        
        using this command line:
        
            edxcut test test_data/test_demo_course.yaml
        
        Note that you may need to change the `url_name` for the first three
        cases, which have a edx-studio-specific hexstring, if using a different VM
        instance.
        
        Unit tests
