Description: Docker Compose for Swarm Mode
        =============================
        
        Drop in replacement for docker-compose that works with swarm mode
        introduced in Docker 1.12.
        
        Motivation
        ----------
        
        Docker 1.12 with its new `Swarm
        mode <https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/>`__ has been out for a
        while, but Docker Compose - the great tool for running multi-container
        configurations - still (1.5+ months after Docker release) doesn't
        support it.
        
        The only thing they offer is generating a
        `DAB <https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/experimental/docker-stacks-and-bundles.md>`__
        file from your ``docker-compose.yml`` and deploying it to Docker.
        However DAB doesn't support a lot of ``docker-compose.yml`` stuff and
        deploying it to Docker is an experimental feature that is not supported
        yet in the latest 1.12.1 release.
        
        So you should either stick with the previous version of Docker or throw
        out all your docker-compose files and run a bunch of long
        ``docker service ...`` commands.
        
        Neither option looked good to me so, as a temporary solution (I still
        hope Docker Compose with swarm mode support will be released soon), I've
        created a script that parses a ``docker-compose.yml`` file, generates
        ``docker service ...`` commands for you and runs them.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        docker-compose-swarm-mode is available on
        `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docker-compose-swarm-mode>`__.
        
        ``pip install docker-compose-swarm-mode``
        
        Or just download the ``.py`` script.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        Python 2.7+.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The script tries its best to support the CLI of the original Docker
        Compose so just use it as you would use Docker Compose.
        
        Use ``--dry-run`` option if you'd first like to check what ``docker``
        commands are to be executed.
        
        The script currently doesn't support all docker-compose commands,
        options, and ``yml`` keys. It just supports what I've needed in my
        projects so far. See the usage help with ``-h`` flag and try the script
        with your ``docker-compose.yml``, it'll tell you if there are
        unsupported keys.
        
        In case you need something that is not supported yet, feel free to
        create an issue and/or submit a pull request.
        
        Keys that are silently ignored because they are not supported by
        ``docker service``: \* container\_name \* expose \* extra\_hosts \*
        hostname
