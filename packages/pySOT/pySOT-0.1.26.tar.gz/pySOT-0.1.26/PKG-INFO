        | ## pySOT: Surrogate Optimization Toolbox
        
        pySOT is an asynchronous parallel optimization toolbox for global
        deterministic optimization problems. The main purpose of the toolbox is
        for optimization of computationally expensive black-box objective
        functions with continuous and/or integer variables where the number of
        evaluations is limited. If there are several processors available it may
        make sense to evaluate the objective function using either asynchronous
        or synchronous parallel. pySOT uses the event-driven framework for
        asynchronous optimization strategies POAP
        (https://github.com/dbindel/POAP) to provide this functionality.
        
        The toolbox is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/dme65/pySOT

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Make sure you have Python 2.7.x and pip installed. The easiest way to
        install pySOT is using:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install pySOT

        ----
        
        A two-hour short course on how to use pySOT was given at the CMWR 2016
        conference in Toronto. The slides and Python notebooks can be downloaded
        from: https://people.cam.cornell.edu/~dme65/talks.html

        FAQ
        ---
        
        | Q: I can't find the GUI
        | A: You need to install PySide
        
        | Q: I can't find the MARS interpolant
        | A: You need to install py-earth (https://github.com/jcrudy/py-earth)
        
        | Q: I used pySOT for my research and want to cite it
        | A: There is currently no published paper on pySOT so we recommend
          citing pySOT like this: *D. Eriksson, D. Bindel, and C. Shoemaker.
          Surrogate Optimization Toolbox (pySOT). github.com/dme65/pySOT, 2015*
        
        | Q: Is there support for Python 3?
        | A: pySOT currently doesn't support Python 3, mainly because of some
          pySOT dependencies lacking Python 3 support.
