        ## pySOT: Surrogate Optimization Toolbox
        
        pySOT is an asynchronous parallel optimization toolbox for global deterministic 
        optimization problems. The main purpose of the toolbox is for optimization of 
        computationally expensive black-box objective functions with continuous and/or 
        integer variables where the number of evaluations is limited. If there are several 
        processors available it may make sense to evaluate the objective function using 
        either asynchronous or synchronous parallel. pySOT uses the event-driven framework 
        for asynchronous optimization strategies POAP (https://github.com/dbindel/POAP) 
        to provide this functionality.
        
        The toolbox is hosted on GitHub: [https://github.com/dme65/pySOT](https://github.com/dme65/pySOT)

        ## Installation
        
        Make sure you have Python 2.7.x and pip installed. The easiest way to 
        install pySOT is using: 
        
        ``` bash
        pip install pySOT
        ```

        ## News
        A two-hour short course on how to use pySOT was given at the CMWR 2016 
        conference in Toronto. The slides and Python notebooks can be downloaded from:

        ## FAQ
        
        Q: I can't find the GUI  
        A: You need to install PySide
        
        Q: I can't find the MARS interpolant  
        A: You need to install py-earth (https://github.com/jcrudy/py-earth)
        
        Q: I used pySOT for my research and want to cite it  
        A: There is currently no published paper on pySOT so we recommend citing 
        pySOT like this: *D. Eriksson, D. Bindel, and C. Shoemaker. Surrogate 
        Optimization Toolbox (pySOT). github.com/dme65/pySOT, 2015*
        
        Q: Is there support for Python 3?  
        A: pySOT currently doesn't support Python 3, mainly because of some pySOT dependencies lacking Python 3 support.
