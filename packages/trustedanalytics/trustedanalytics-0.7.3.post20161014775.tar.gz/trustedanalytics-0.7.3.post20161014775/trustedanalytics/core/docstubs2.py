            Create a 'new' instance of an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

        An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) [1]_ model is a
        generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model.
        These models are fitted to time series data either to better understand
        the data or to predict future points in the series (forecasting).
        Non-seasonal ARIMA models are generally denoted ARIMA (p,d,q) where
        parameters p, d, and q are non-negative integers, p is the order of the
        Autoregressive model, d is the degree of differencing, and q is the order
        of the Moving-average model.

        Consider the following frame of observations collected over seven days.

        The frame has three columns: timestamp, name, and value.

        >>> frame.inspect()
        [#]  timestamp                 name   value

        [6]  2015-01-07T00:00:00.000Z  Sarah  15.12102595



        Define the date time index:

        >>> datetimeindex = ['2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z','2015-01-02T00:00:00.000Z',
        ... '2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z','2015-01-04T00:00:00.000Z','2015-01-05T00:00:00.000Z',
        ... '2015-01-06T00:00:00.000Z','2015-01-07T00:00:00.000Z']

        Then, create a time series frame from the frame of observations, since the ARIMA model
        expects data to be in a time series format (where the time series values are in a
        vector column).

        >>> ts = frame.timeseries_from_observations(datetimeindex, "timestamp","name","value")
        [===Job Progress===]

        >>> ts.inspect()
        [#]  name
        ==========
        [0]  Sarah
        <BLANKLINE>
        [#]  value

        Use the frame take function to get one row of data with just the "value" column

        >>> ts_frame_data = ts.take(n=1,offset=0,columns=["value"])

        From the ts_frame_data, get the first row and first column to extract out just the time series values.

        >>> ts_values = ts_frame_data[0][0]

        >>> ts_values
        [12.88969427,
         13.54964408,

         14.2499628,
         15.12102595]

        Create an ARIMA model:

        >>> model = ta.ArimaModel()
        [===Job Progress===]

        Train the model using the timeseries frame:

        >>> model.train(ts_values, 1, 0, 1)
        [===Job Progress===]
        {u'coefficients': [9.864444620964322, 0.2848511106449633, 0.47346114378593795]}

        Call predict to forecast values by passing the number of future periods to predict beyond the length of the time series.
        Since the parameter in this example is 0, predict will forecast 7 values (the same number of values that were in the
        original time series vector).

        >>> model.predict(0)
        [===Job Progress===]
        {u'forecasted': [12.674342627141744,

          14.201275185574925]}

        >>> model.publish()
        [===Job Progress===]

        Take the path to the published model and run it in the Scoring Engine:

        >>> import requests
        >>> headers = {'Content-type': 'application/json', 'Accept': 'application/json,text/plain'}

        Post a request to get the metadata about the model.

        >>> r = requests.get('http://mymodel.demotrustedanalytics.com/v2/metadata')
        >>> r.text
        u'{"model_details":{"model_type":"ARIMA Model","model_class":"com.cloudera.sparkts.models.ARIMAModel","model_reader":"org.trustedanalytics.atk.scoring.models.ARIMAModelReaderPlugin","custom_values":{}},"input":[{"name":"timeseries","value":"Array[Double]"},{"name":"future","value":"Int"}],"output":[{"name":"timeseries","value":"Array[Double]"},{"name":"future","value":"Int"},{"name":"predicted_values","value":"Array[Double]"}]}'

        ARIMA model support started in version 2 of the scoring engine REST API. We send the number of values to forecast
        beyond the length of the time series (in this example we are passing 0). This means that since 7 historical time series
        values were provided, 7 future periods will be forecasted.

        >>> r = requests.post('http://mymodel.demotrustedanalytics.com/v2/score',json={"records":[{"future":0}]})

        The 'predicted_values' array contains the future values, which have been forecasted based on the historical data.

        >>> r.text

            Create a 'new' instance of an Intel DAAL Principal Components model.

        Principal component analysis [1]_ is a statistical algorithm
        that converts possibly correlated features to linearly uncorrelated variables
        called principal components.
        The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of
        original variables.
        This implementation of computing Principal Components is done by Singular
        Value Decomposition [2]_ of the data, providing the user with an option to
        mean center the data.
        The Principal Components model is initialized; trained on
        specifying the observation columns of the frame and the number of components;
        used to predict principal components.
        The Intel DAAL Singular Value Decomposition [3]_ implementation has been used for
        this, with additional features to 1) mean center the data during train and
        predict and 2) compute the t-squared index during prediction.

            used in the LDA model. Setting the random seed to the same value every
            time the model is trained, allows LDA to generate the same topic distribution

            Create a 'new' instance of a Support Vector Machine model.

        Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
        perform binary classification.
        A support vector machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
        said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance to
        the nearest training-data point of any class. This model runs the
        LIBSVM [2]_ [3]_ implementation of SVM.
        The LIBSVM model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
        predict the labels of observations in a frame and used to test the predicted
        labels against the true labels.
        During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
        the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Linear Regression model.

        Linear Regression [1]_ is used to model the relationship between a scalar
        dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
        The Linear Regression model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame and
        used to predict the value of the dependent variable given the independent
        observations of a frame.

        Logistic Regression [1]_ is a widely used supervised binary and multi-class classification algorithm.
        The Logistic Regression model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, predicts the labels
        of observations, and tests the predicted labels against the true labels.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of Logistic Regression [2]_, with enhanced features |EM|
        trained model summary statistics; Covariance and Hessian matrices; ability to specify the frequency
        of the train and test observations.
        Testing performance can be viewed via built-in binary and multi-class Classification Metrics.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Naive Bayes model

        Naive Bayes [1]_ is a probabilistic classifier with strong
        independence assumptions between features.
        It computes the conditional probability distribution of each feature given label,
        and then applies Bayes' theorem to compute the conditional probability
        distribution of a label given an observation, and use it for prediction.
        The Naive Bayes model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, tested against true labels of a frame and used
        to predict the value of the dependent variable given the independent
        observations of a frame and test the performance of the classification on test data.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of Naive Bayes [2]_.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Principal Components model.

        Principal component analysis [1]_ is a statistical algorithm
        that converts possibly correlated features to linearly uncorrelated variables
        called principal components.
        The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of
        original variables.
        This implementation of computing Principal Components is done by Singular
        Value Decomposition [2]_ of the data, providing the user with an option to
        mean center the data.
        The Principal Components model is initialized; trained on
        specifying the observation columns of the frame and the number of components;
        used to predict principal components.
        The MLLib Singular Value Decomposition [3]_ implementation has been used for
        this, with additional features to 1) mean center the data during train and
        predict and 2) compute the t-squared index during prediction.

            Create a 'new' instance of a Support Vector Machine model.

        Support Vector Machine [1]_ is a supervised algorithm used to
        perform binary classification.
        A Support Vector Machine constructs a high dimensional hyperplane which is
        said to achieve a good separation when a hyperplane has the largest distance
        to the nearest training-data point of any class.
        This model runs the MLLib implementation of SVM [2]_ with SGD [3]_ optimizer.
        The SVMWithSGD model is initialized, trained on columns of a frame, used to
        predict the labels of observations in a frame, and tests the predicted labels
        against the true labels.
        During testing, labels of the observations are predicted and tested against
        the true labels using built-in binary Classification Metrics.
