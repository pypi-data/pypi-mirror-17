            payload = {
                "token": "FZeDswE6ju0ONCL3864",    # Token returned from account tokenization request
                "amount": "100",                   # Amount to debit from account
                "narration": "payment for coffee", # Description for this payment
                "country": "NG"                    # country of debit source
            }
        
            r = flw.account.charge(payload)
            print "{}".format(r.text)
        
            # Response
            # {
            #   {
            #       "transactionreference":"FLW00292801",
            #       "responseMessage":"Approved or Completed Successfully",
            #       "responseCode":"00"
            #   },
            #   "status":"success"
