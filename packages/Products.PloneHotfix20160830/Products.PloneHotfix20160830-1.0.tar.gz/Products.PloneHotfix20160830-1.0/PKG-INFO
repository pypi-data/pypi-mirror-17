Description: Plone hotfix, 2016-08-30
        ========================
        
        This hotfix fixes several security issues:
        
        - An attacker could bypass Plone's security method to check if a url is a valid,
          safe url on the site which can lead to XSS attacks on certain pages.
        - In multiple places, Plone blindly uses the `referer` header to redirect a user
          to the next page after a particular action. An attacker could utilize this to
          draw a user into a redirection attack.
        - z3c.form will currently accept data from GET requests when the form is supposed
          to be POST. This allows a user to inject a potential XSS attack into a form,
          which when saved, will cause a XSS attack. Moreover, with certain widgets in Plone
          admin forms, the input is expected to be safe and can cause a reflexive XSS
          attack.
        - Fixes XSS on user information page.
        - Fixes XSS on multiple ZMI pages
        - By using relative paths and guessing locations on a server Plone is installed
          on, an attacker can read data from a target server that the process running
          Plone has permission to read. The attacker needs administrator privileges on
          the Plone site to perform this attack.
        
        
        
        This hotfix should be applied to the following versions of Plone:
        
        * Plone 5.0.6 and any earlier 5.x version
        * Plone 4.3.11 and any earlier 4.x version
        * Any older version of Plone
        
        The hotfix is officially supported by the Plone security team on the
        following versions of Plone in accordance with the Plone
        `version support policy`_: 4.0.10, 4.1.6, 4.2.7, 4.3.11 and 5.0.6.
        However it has also received some testing on older versions of Plone.
        The fixes included here will be incorporated into subsequent releases of Plone,
        so Plone 4.3.12, 5.0.7 and greater should not require this hotfix.

          The exact number of patches applied, will differ depending on what packages you are using.
          If a patch is attempted but fails, it will be logged as a warning that says
          "Could not apply". This may indicate that you have a non-standard Plone
          installation.

        Q: How can I report other potential security vulnerabilities?

          potential security issues publicly.
