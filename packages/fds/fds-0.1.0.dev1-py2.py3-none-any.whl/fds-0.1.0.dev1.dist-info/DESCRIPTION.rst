# What's it for

fds is a research tool for computational simulations that exhibis
chaotic dynamics. It computes sensitivity derivatives of time averaged
quantities, a.k.a. statistics, with respect simulation parameters.

For an introduction of chaotic dynamics, I highly recommend [Strogatz's
excellent book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813349109). For a
statistical view of chaotic dynamical systems, please refer to
[Berlinger's article](http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/1992/berliner1992a.pdf).
Algorithm used in this software is described in [the upcoming AIAA
paper](https://dl.dropbox.com/s/2e9jxjmwh375i01/fds.pdf)

# Download and use

The best way to download fds is using pip. Pip is likely included in
your Python installation. If not, see [instruction
here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). To install fds
using pip, simply type

```
sudo pip install fds
```
