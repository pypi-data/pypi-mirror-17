        Scratch API Interface
        
        ScratchAPI is a scratch API interface written in Python.
        
        To get started, install it with pip install scratchapi
        
        Logging in
        
        To use the api, you must log in to your scratch account:
        
          import scratchapi
          scratch = scratchapi.ScratchUserSession('Username', 'password')
        
        Now, you can verify your session to see if you logged in correctly:
        
          scratch.tools.verify_session()
        
        There are a lot of things you can you when you're logged in!
        
        Take ownership of a new project:
        
          scratch.lib.utils.request(path='/internalapi/project/new/set/?v=v442&title=Project', server=scratch.PROJECTS_SERVER, method='POST', payload={})
        
        Follow Someone:
        
          scratch.users.follow('Bob')
        
        Set a cloud variable:
        
          s.cloud.set_var('Variable', 12345, 4453648)
        
        Credits
        The cloud data interface information was acquired from various topics on the Scratch Forums.
        
        TheLogFather helped out with various wrappers and conveniences for cloud data.
