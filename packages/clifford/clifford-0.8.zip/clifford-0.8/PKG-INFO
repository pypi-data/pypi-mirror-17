Description: 
        This module implements geometric algebras (a.k.a. Clifford algebras). For the uninitiated, a geometric algebra is an algebra of vectors of given dimensions and signature. The familiar inner (dot) product and the outer product, a generalized relative of the three-dimensional cross product, are unified in an invertible geometric product. Scalars, vectors, and higher-grade entities can be mixed freely and consistently in the form of mixed-grade multivectors.
