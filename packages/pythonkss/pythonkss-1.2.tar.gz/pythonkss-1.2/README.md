# PythonKSS - Knyle Style Sheets

PythonKSS is a Python implementation of [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss). KSS attempts to provide a
methodology for writing maintainable, documented CSS within a team.

It was originally forked from https://github.com/seanbrant/pykss to be more 
compatible with https://www.npmjs.com/package/kss, but we have added a lot
more features, such as Markdown support in description, code hilighting with
Pygments, API docs, and more.

The official [page](http://warpspire.com/kss/) provide a good introduction to KSS.
