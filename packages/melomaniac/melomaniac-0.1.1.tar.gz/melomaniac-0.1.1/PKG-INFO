Description: Melomaniac
        ##########
        
        Listen to your Google Play Music and Soundcloud library from your terminal.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        - Python 3.5+
        - mpv
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code-block::
        
            pip install melomaniac
        
        You will also need to install `mpv <https://mpv.io>`_ to actually play the songs.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To launch the player, just do:
        
        .. code-block::
        
            melomaniac listen gmusic
        
        or
        
        .. code-block::
        
            melomaniac listen soundcloud
        
        
        If this is the first time using a specific backend, Melomaniac will ask you
        a few pieces of information:
        
        - **Gmusic**: ``username`` and ``password``. There is no way around it. If you have 2FA activated for you account you must create an application specific password.
        
        - **Soundcloud**: ``client_id``, ``client_secret``, ``username`` and ``password``. You need to `acquire a client credential for your application <http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new>`_, in order for Melomaniac to work. Both ``username`` and ``password`` will only be used once to retrieve API tokens and will never be stored.
        
        The configuration is stored in ``~/.melomaniac/config.yml``.
        
        
        ### Commands
        
        - Access an element (``right`` or ``enter``)
        - Navigate a list (``up``/``down``)
        - Play a song (``enter``)
        - Pause/Resume a song (``space``)
        - Forward/Rewind (``f``/``r``)
        - Quit (``q``)
