**A friendly greeting for your services!**

`ahoyhoy` is intended as a universal service client for python/django applications.

`ahoyhoy` goals:
- Circuit breaking to prevent repeated bad behavior
- Retries because in reality, things go down.
- Provide a standard service discovery and resolution interface for Python apps and services.
- Include all required information in each request before sending it to downstream services


And a little bit of `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoy_(greeting)>`_

    a signal word used to call to a ship or boat, stemming from the Middle English cry, 'Hoy!'.

Alexander Graham Bell originally suggested `ahoy` be adopted as the standard greeting when answering a telephone, before 'hello' (suggested by Thomas Edison) became common.
