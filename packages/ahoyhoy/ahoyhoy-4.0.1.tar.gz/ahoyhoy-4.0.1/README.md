*And a little bit of [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahoy_(greeting)):*

`Ahoy` is a signal word used to call to a ship or boat, stemming from the Middle English cry, 'Hoy!'.

Alexander Graham Bell originally suggested `ahoy` be adopted as the standard greeting when answering a telephone, before 'hello' (suggested by Thomas Edison) became common.
