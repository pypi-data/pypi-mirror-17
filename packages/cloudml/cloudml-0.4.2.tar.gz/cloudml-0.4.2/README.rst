CloudML
=======

A set of tools that allow building a classifier on the cloud.


It consists of three components:

1. Import handler: a utility module which is responsible for feeding the trainer and the predictor with data.
2. Trainer: which receives data from the import handler and trains a classifier to produce a classification model.
3. Predictor: which uses a model produced by the trainer in order to predict the class of incoming requests.
