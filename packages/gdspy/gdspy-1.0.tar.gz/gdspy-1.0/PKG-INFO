Description: Gdspy is a Python  module for creating/importing/merging GDSII stream files.
        It includes key libraries for creating complex CAD layouts:
        
        * Boolean operations on polygons (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) based on clipping algorithm
        * Polygon offset (inward and outward rescaling of polygons)
        * Efficient point-in-polygon solutions for large array sets
        
        Gdspy also includes a simple layout viewer.
        
        Typical applications of Gdspy are in the fields of electronic chip design, planar lightwave circuit design, and mechanical engineering.
